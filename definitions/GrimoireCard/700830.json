    "cardDescription": "AT LAST!<br/><br/>\nWe knew curiosity would draw you back, Auryx. In their desperation, the Ammonite have begun using paracausal weapons.<br/><br/>\nWhat are these? How do they work? Wouldn\u2019t you like to know. Suffice to say that some powers in this universe are superordinate to mere material physics.<br/><br/>\nThe source of these weapons is the Traveler, the Sky\u2019s bait star. Their effect is subtle, but devastating.<br/><br/>\nBut you are armed to respond in kind. Savath&#251;n\u2019s mothers have listened carefully to our teachings. We will not give you the Deep, King Auryx \u2014 that power is for us, your gods. But we will teach you to call upon that force with signs and rituals.<br/><br/>\nSmall minds might call it magic.<br/><br/>\nYou are no longer bound by causal closure. Your will defeats law. Kill a hundred of your children with a long blade, Auryx, and observe the change in the blade. Observe how the universe shrinks from you in terror.<br/><br/>\nYour existence begins to define itself.<br/><br/>\nOf course, high Auryx, we know it was not curiosity alone that brought you back to the war. You felt your own death growing inside you.<br/><br/>\nYou must obey your nature. Your worm must feed...",
