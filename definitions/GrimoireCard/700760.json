    "cardDescription": "You are Aurash. Heir to the Osmium Throne.<br/><br/>\nYou stand on the naked hull of an ancient ship. You stand exposed to the crushing pressure and ferocious heat of the deeper Fundament. It should annihilate you. It is by my will alone that you survive.<br/><br/>\nI am Yul, the Honest Worm.<br/><br/>\nBehold my passage. Behold my vast displacement, my ponderous strength, my great and coiling length, my folded jaws and curled wings. Behold the hiving cities symbiotic with my flesh. I am fecund, Aurash. I am at the beginning and end of lives.<br/><br/>\nBehold Eir, and Xol, and Ur, and Akka. The Virtuous Worms. Look upon us, and know that We are go[o]d.<br/><br/>\nFor millions of years We have been [trapped|growing] in the Deep. From across the stars We have called life to Fundament, so that it might contend against extinction. For millennia We have awaited you... our beloved hosts.<br/><br/>\nAgainst you stand the cruel Leviathan and all the forces of the Sky. They would crush you down into the dark. They have arranged their moons to drown you, in fear of your potential.<br/><br/>\nWe want to help you, Princes. We offer to each of you a bargain... a symbiosis.<br/><br/>\nTake into your bodies our children, our newborn larvae. From them you shall obtain eternal life. From them you shall gain power over your own fragile flesh: the power to make of it as you will. And should you find an imperfection in the world, an injustice or an inconvenience \u2014 you will have the power to repair it. Let no mere law bind you.<br/><br/>\nWe ask one thing in exchange, oh Princes.<br/><br/>\nYou must obey your nature forever. In your immortality, Aurash, you may never cease to explore and inquire, for the sake of your children. In your immortality, Xi Ro, you may never cease to test your strength. In your immortality, Sathona, you may never abandon cunning.<br/><br/>\nIf you do, your worm will consume you. And as your power grows, oh Princes, so will your worm\u2019s appetite.<br/><br/>\nBut we offer eternity, Aurash. We offer you a chance at the universe. Would you deny your people infinity?<br/><br/>\nReach up to me. Let my flesh be your sacrament.",
