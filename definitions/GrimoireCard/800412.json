    "cardDescription": "Deep inside a clandestine stronghold sat the Dark Horse Felwinter and Citan, Warlord of the 32nd Sector of Old Russia. A polished obsidian table rested heavily between them.<br/><br/>\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the courage to come back here,\u201d said the Warlord.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSituational awareness. Not courage. I go where I can do the most good. Thank you for seeing me.\u201d Felwinter\u2019s voice sounded as hollow as his helmet. Citan wanted to knock it clean off the Iron Lord\u2019s bony shoulders. He could do it with a single punch.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAs I recall, you used to have a throne on that Light-forsaken peak, \u2018til you joined up with the wolves. You\u2019re the only Warlord I know who held an entire mountain.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cFelwinter Peak.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo one ever calls it that.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe Iron Lords do. Though they did ask me to take that throne down.\u201d<br/><br/>\nCitan\u2019s laugh shook the room. \u201cHow is losing territory ever a good thing for a Warlord?\u201d Felwinter folded his hands atop the table. Underneath it, Citan made two fists, a crescent of Light flickering between them.<br/><br/>\n\u201cJoin us and find out,\u201d said the Iron Lord. \u201cTurn your sector over to us. You can still patrol it, of course.\u201d<br/><br/>\nCitan\u2019s voice lowered.  \u201cOf course. You know I\u2019ll refuse.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll put you down, and take your territory by force. Over and over again if we have to.\u201d<br/><br/>\n \u201cI invite you to my home after you abandon us, and you come to threaten me?\u201d The Warlord stood, towering over Felwinter.<br/><br/>\n\u201cTo broker peace.\u201d Citan thought that even the voice behind the helmet didn\u2019t believe what it said. The floor shuddered as the Warlord upended the massive table with one hand.  It smashed into the opposite wall, as tendrils of Void Light passed through it and coalesced into Felwinter\u2019s leaping form.<br/><br/>\nCitan had seen this parlor trick before, and judged that he could hammer the Iron Lord out of the air\u2014<br/><br/>\nBut Felwinter\u2019s momentum continued into a knee-lift that smashed into Citan\u2019s head as the larger man reared back to strike. The Warlord fell, the front of his helm shattering. Felwinter landed next to Citan\u2019s prone body.<br/><br/>\n\u201cLady Jolder taught me that. I can\u2019t say the Iron Lords haven\u2019t done me any favors,\u201d the voice intoned. <br/><br/>\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ll burn the world down before we let the Iron Lords rule it,\u201d the larger man gasped, breathing out of his mouth, his face a bloody mess. The Void Light in Felwinter\u2019s hand snapped\u2014and so did the Warlord\u2019s neck.<br/><br/>\n\u201cRadegast is scattered. Perun is indecisive. Silimar wants to build a tower and hide. But they\u2019re going to change the world; no one can stop them,\u201d Felwinter said quietly to the corpse. He parted his coat and drew a bronze shotgun. \u201cWill it be for the better? I don\u2019t know. But they mean to end the fighting, so I don\u2019t have to sleep with my back to the wall every night, Light in my hand. And that\u2019s not nothing.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe paused, as if waiting for something.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNormally, this is where I ask you to reconsider. Tell you that you should come with me. See how powerful your Light can become. But I know you, Citan. What you do with the land you take, with its people. The other Lords\u2014especially Saladin\u2014might let you walk away. I\u2019m not going to give them the chance.\u201d<br/><br/>\nCitan\u2019s Ghost sparked into view from above, bringing its eye to bear on its fallen charge. The Warlord emerged from a radiant column, a frenzied shout at his lips.<br/><br/>\nFelwinter\u2019s shotgun cracked like thunder\u2014once for the Warlord, and again for his Ghost.",
