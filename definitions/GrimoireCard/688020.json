    "cardDescription": "The Maraid, Book VII, Chapter 10<br/><br/>\nAbstract:<br/>\nThe transmission was broadcasted on all Fallen frequencies. Lacking, at the time, the ability to crack Fallen encryptions, the Master of Crows could discern only that the Fallen Houses were all talking to each other. That was a thing that had never happened before.<br/><br/>\nThen the Techeuns looked Earthward\u2014and saw the Fallen there becoming bolder. Tactics suggested they were planning a massive attack. We had no interplanetary arrays\u2014no way to warn Earth. We thought we would be able to do nothing but watch.<br/><br/>\nBut then the Wolves arrived from the Jovians. Their army was hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions strong: a dark wave that washed over the Reef, rushing toward the Earth. As soon as we saw them it was clear that if the Wolves reached Earth, the City would fall.<br/><br/>\nSeemingly oblivious to our existence, the bulk of the Wolf fleet stopped to regroup at Ceres. The Queen&#39;s decision was this: attack the House of Wolves, thereby saving Earth but revealing the Reef&#39;s presence to any and all enemies in the quadrant; or remain silent, preserving the Reef&#39;s invisibility but allowing the City to perish.<br/><br/>\nHer Harbingers ripped into Ceres, destroying the asteroid and killing Virixas, Kell of Wolves and more than half his House. The remaining Wolves scattered, burrowing deep into the Belt for cover. There, new claimants to the Kellship quickly arose: Irxis, Wolf Baroness; Parixas, the Howling; and Skolas, the Rabid.",
