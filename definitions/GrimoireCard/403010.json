    "cardDescription": "Every wayward soul unlucky enough to be born outside The City&#39;s protecting arms whispers its truth across the wastes: a metropolis, risen from the ashes of the Collapse, sheltered by the Traveler. It is a promise and a dream, the only refuge from the Darkness.<br/><br/>\nThe City is a thriving walled ecumene, rich with the languages and traditions of every surviving human and neohuman culture. The City&#39;s population faces real challenges: inequality, fear, scarcity, and the specter of internal strife. But the great traditions of the Golden Age live on, and many classes of suffering and injustice have been eradicated forever.",
