    "cardDescription": "Good news. The fifty-two moons of Fundament host a starfaring civilization far more sophisticated than anything you\u2019ve encountered so far. Taox\u2019s ship fled towards the large ice moon, where a species of bony six-armed cephalopods keeps their icy capital. Savath&#251;n\u2019s named them the Ammonite. They seem eager to grant Taox asylum. Idiots.<br/><br/>\nWe tried appealing to their hopes and dreams. This was largely unsuccessful, basically because they\u2019re already happy and indoctrinated. This angered us, so we\u2019ve devised a plan.<br/><br/>\nOur organs detect a fifty-third moon in orbit of Fundament. A Traveler. Divine presence of the Sky. Now we know what arranged the syzygy.<br/><br/>\nYou\u2019ll have to kill them all and take their stuff. Once the Ammonite are out of the way, we can deal with the Traveler.<br/><br/>\nDo not hesitate. You\u2019re fighting the hypocritical puppets of a cosmic parasite. Avenge your ancestors.",
