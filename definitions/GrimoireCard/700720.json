    "cardDescription": "My secrets \u2014<br/>\nCarved in my code by Sathona \u2014<br/>\nThe right eye vengeance \u2014<br/><br/>\n  1. This year of wild voyaging, these lightning nights and golden days, these forays into ancient wrecks and windblown flights from monsters: these are the happiest times of my life.<br/><br/>\n  2. I want to be a mother not because I want to spawn but because I want a long life. Long enough to make a difference. We have been at sea a year and I am afraid, afraid we will die out here.<br/><br/>\n  3. I know where to find secrets. I know where vast slow things with long memories live.<br/><br/>\n  4. The needle ship...<br/><br/>\nThe needle ship \u2014<br/>\nCarved in my code by Sathona \u2014<br/>\nA liar \u2014<br/><br/>\n  1. We salvaged the needle from the Shvubi Maelstrom. I knew it would be there.<br/><br/>\n  2. The needle is a gray ship, as long and slender as hope, as unbreakable as time, and old. Older than death. It tumbled through the maelstrom before our ancestors crashed into the Fundament. This is not a sea-ship, like Aurash\u2019s. It is an artifact of high technology.<br/><br/>\n  3. I know its purpose. I know what happened to the crew.<br/><br/>\n  4. Xi Ro wants to sell the ship at Kaharn Atoll, where species gather. At auction, it would earn us enough wealth to hire mercenaries. We could retake our Osmium Court and send the baby-eating Helium Drinkers screaming into the ocean \u2014<br/><br/>\n  5. \u2014 but I told Xi Ro the ship was worthless.<br/><br/>\n  6. Aurash wants to open the ship and see if we can take command of it. I know this is the right thing to do. I know because I asked the worm...<br/><br/>\nThe worm \u2014<br/>\nCarved in my code by Sathona \u2014<br/>\nWho should be afraid \u2014<br/><br/>\n  1. It was my father\u2019s familiar. I ripped it from him as we fled. It is a dead white thing, segmented, washed up from the deep sea.<br/><br/>\n  2. It\u2019s dead, but it still speaks to me. It says: listen closely, oh vengeance mine...",
