    "cardDescription": "Let us speak of the terrible beauty of becoming ourselves.<br/><br/>\nIn the beginning we rode hollow moons from star to star. AURYX said, become as numerous and fertile as seeds in rich flesh, and thus we did become numerous. XIVU ARATH said, become as hungry and defiant as tumors in rich flesh, and thus we became cancerous. SAVATH&#219;N said, drink of the poisons of the worm, so that you might feed on death, and we did feed. This was preparation for our crusade.<br/><br/>\nAia! We were thus becoming.<br/><br/>\nA mother Wizard gets fertility from a mate, or from herself. From the Wizard the spawn, from the spawn our Thrall, from the survivors our Acolytes who contend. If they contend well, their worm is fed, and from the well fed worm come Knights and Wizards and Princes.<br/><br/>\nThis is us, and our purpose is liberation, our great task is the worship and admiration of freedom, our great hunger is to pursue and eat that which is not free, and to liberate it with devouring. Aiat. This is us, we the Hive.",
