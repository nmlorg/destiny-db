    "cardDescription": "It was the fourth night of the seventh moon.<br/><br/>\nNine rises since any sign.<br/><br/>\nTrail wasn&#39;t cold, but lukewarm would&#39;ve been an exaggeration.<br/><br/>\nJaren had us hold by a ravine.<br/><br/>\nThe heavy wood along the cliffs&#39; edge caught the wind, holding back the cold and the rush of water muffled our conversation.<br/><br/>\nWe&#39;d seen dual Skiffs hanging low as they cut through the valley.<br/><br/>\nWasn&#39;t known Fallen territory, but anymore that&#39;s a dangerous assumption.<br/><br/>\nThere were six of us then.<br/><br/>\nThree less than two moons prior, but still, one more than when we&#39;d first turned our backs to Palamon&#39;s ash.<br/><br/>\nWe took a rotation for watch during the night.<br/><br/>\nMovement was kept to a minimum and communication was down to hand signals and simple gestures.<br/><br/>\nWe could hold our own in a fight, but only the dead went looking for one\u2014a hard truth that cut in direct opposition to our reasons for being so far from anything resembling civilization, much less our safety.<br/><br/>\nThe Skiffs had spooked Kressler and Nada, and, in truth, me as well. But, looking back, I think we were all just grasping for any good reason to turn back.<br/><br/>\nNot because we would\u2014turn back\u2014but because it seemed to be our only real hope, and I think we all knew it.<br/><br/>\nForward. Where we were headed\u2014into the unknown. And following the footsteps we were. It all just started to feel like a never-ending dead end after a while.<br/><br/>\nJaren never wavered though. Not once.<br/><br/>\nAt least not to any noticeable degree.<br/><br/>\nIt was his drive, his conviction, that kept us going.<br/><br/>\nAnd\u2014it&#39;s hard to think on\u2014but if I&#39;m honest, it was his death that rekindled my own fire. A fire that was all but exhausted on that cold night.<br/><br/>\nHe seemed confident we were close.<br/><br/>\nBut more than confident\u2014sure. He seemed sure.<br/><br/>\nNo one else felt it\u2014our own confidence, and any enthusiasm we&#39;d had was set to wither soon as Brevin, Trenn and Mel were gunned down.<br/><br/>\nThe Ghost\u2014Jaren&#39;s Ghost\u2014never said a word to any of us. Just hung there. Always alert. Always judging. Not us, per se, but the moment. Any moment.<br/><br/>\nI never got the sense it thought of us as lesser. More that it was guarded, wary.<br/><br/>\nWe knew it could speak. We&#39;d overheard them a few times. Just brief words, and no one ever pressed the subject.<br/><br/>\nFrom time to time I caught its gaze lingering on me, but always assumed the attention was a result of the bond Jaren and I had. He was a father to me. At the time I didn&#39;t know why he&#39;d singled me out as someone to care for. Someone to protect. After all the loss, I welcomed it, but looking back\u2014taking in the arm&#39;s length at which he kept the others\u2014I guess I should&#39;ve known, or at least suspected there was more to it.<br/><br/>\nWe all woke that night, closer to morning than the previous day.<br/><br/>\nA crack of gunfire split through the wood. Then more.<br/><br/>\nFar off, but near enough to pump the blood.<br/><br/>\nA familiar ring. &quot;Last Word.&quot; Jaren&#39;s sidearm. His best friend.<br/>\nThen another. A single shot, an unmistakable echo calling through the night. Hushed, cutting.<br/><br/>\nOne shot, dark and infernal. Followed by silence.<br/><br/>\nWe crouched low and quiet. Listening. Hoping.<br/><br/>\nJaren was gone. Off on his own.<br/><br/>\nMaybe we were closer than we&#39;d allowed ourselves to believe.<br/><br/>\nToo close.<br/><br/>\nHe&#39;d gone to face death alone.<br/><br/>\nI couldn&#39;t admit it\u2014not at the time\u2014but he thought he was <br/>\nprotecting us.<br/><br/>\nAfter such a long road\u2014years on its heels, a trail littered with suffering and fire\u2014maybe he just couldn&#39;t take the thought of anymore dead &quot;kids,&quot; as he called us.<br/><br/>\nThe echoes faded and we all held still. No way to track the direction. No sense in rushing blind.<br/><br/>\nWhat was done was done.<br/><br/>\nThe cadence of the shots fired told a story none of us cared to hear.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Last Word&quot; it hadn&#39;t been. And somewhere in the world, close enough for us to bear absent witness but far enough to be a dream, Jaren Ward lay dead or dying. And there was nothing to be done.<br/><br/>\nHours passed. An eternity.<br/><br/>\nWe held our spot, but as the sun rose the others began to fade back into the world. Without Jaren there was nothing holding us together. No driving force. Vengeance had grown stale as a motivator. Fear and a longing to see more suns rise drove a wedge between duty and desire.<br/><br/>\nBy midday I was alone. I couldn&#39;t leave. Wouldn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nEither I would find Jaren and set him at ease, or the other would find me and that would be a fitting end.<br/><br/>\nDeath marching on.<br/><br/>\nBut then, a motion. Quick and darting. My muscles tensed and my hand shot to the grip of my leadslinger.<br/><br/>\nThen a confirmation of the horrible truth I had already accepted, as Jaren&#39;s Ghost came to a halt a few paces in front of me.<br/><br/>\nI exhaled and slumped forward. Still standing, but broken.<br/>\nThe tiny Light looked me over with a curious tilt to its axis, then shot a beam of light over my body. Scanning me as it had done the very first time we met.<br/><br/>\nI looked up. Staring into its singular glowing eye.<br/><br/>\nAnd it spoke...",
