    "cardDescription": "The Weapons of Sorrow were believed to be nothing more than a myth. But even the darkest myths are born of some truths, and whispers of the Necrochasm have long filled the Light with dread.<br/><br/>\nIt is said the Necrochasm was born in the twilight after Crota\u2019s sword first cracked the Moon. That a lost Guardian\u2019s weapon was altered by the Hive in an attempt to fuse their own dark understanding with humanity\u2019s mastery of war. The result was a weapon that would feed on its owner\u2019s aggression\u2014reaching further when angry eyes drew focus, its hunger rising as it tore through bone and flesh.<br/><br/>\nAny Guardian who comes across the weapon must ask some very simple questions with endlessly complicated answers: Is your Light bright enough to stand, even briefly, in full gaze of the Hive&#39;s abyss? Can it handle what has died and been reborn in those shadows?",
