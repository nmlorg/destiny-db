    "cardDescription": "The chamber was dark.  The seven of them were rarely in a room together anymore, but this was the eve of their greatest journey, a plan that overcame death and spanned universes.<br/><br/>\nThey were all connected in trance, communing as the ancients did.  Speaking would tip their hand to the Harbinger Minds they kept here, trophies from an ageless war, and weapons in the right hands.<br/><br/>\n\u201cOryx could kill her, if she holds on too long.\u201d Sedia offered through the silence, fearing what was to come.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe took an oath long ago, obedience even in the face of defeat.\u201d Nascia despised fear.<br/><br/>\n\u201cOnly a defeat here, now. Not there, then.\u201d Illyn wandered between the two sides of three.  The amulet around her neck marked Illyn as the coven\u2019s mother, granting her visions beyond the veil, places only the Queen could go.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSo we hope.\u201d Kalli had long sought the power of the amulet, but Techeuns are taught not to desire.<br/><br/>\n\u201cOur Queen awaits.\u201d Lissyl attempted to end the challenges.  There was little time and a war to fight.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSo now the decision is nigh. The Harbingers, which to prepare?\u201d Shuro was determined to see this all through.  Excitement was taught to be kept at bay.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe cannot send them all.\u201d Portia reminded.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAll but one, the oldest. It stays with us. Sedia, Kalli, Shuro, take the children, tell her they are to be planted into a dead thing to have children of their own.\u201d A plan hid behind Illyn\u2019s eyes, but Techeuns do not share their eyes with others.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhat if they are not wise enough for the Dreadnaught?\u201d<br/><br/>\nIllyn turned back to the source.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSedia, do you not have faith in our Queen?\u201d",
