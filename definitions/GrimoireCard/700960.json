    "cardDescription": "Oryx made war on the Ecumene for a hundred years. At the end of those hundred years he killed the Ecumene Council on the Fractal Wreath, and from their blood rose Xivu Arath, saying, \u201cI am war, and you have conjured me back with war.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx was glad, for he loved Xivu Arath. The Ecumene wailed in grief.<br/><br/>\nThen Oryx and Xivu Arath made war on the Ecumene for forty years. At the end of those forty years Oryx said to the Dakaua Nest, listen, I am jealous of my sibling Xivu Arath, help me kill her. And in desperation they agreed.<br/><br/>\nBut he drove the Dakaua Nest into a trap, and they were made extinct. From their ashes rose cunning Savath&#251;n, saying, \u201cI am trickery, and you have conjured me back with trickery.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx was glad, for he loved Savath&#251;n. The Ecumene fled into the void.<br/><br/>\nThen they made war on the Ecumene for a thousand years, and exterminated them so wholly that nowhere except in this book are they remembered. This book and the mind of Taox, who was not found.<br/><br/>\nAnd Savath&#251;n said, \u201cKing Oryx, how will we feed our worms? Did you use my plan?\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx told the Hive: I am the Taken King, and here is my law.<br/><br/>\nYou Thrall, each of you will claw and scream, and kill what you can. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow. Tithe the rest to the Acolyte who commands you.<br/><br/>\nYou Acolytes, lead your Thrall in battle. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of the Thrall you lead. Then tithe the remainder to the Knight or Wizard who commands you. Thus you pay tribute.<br/><br/>\nYou Knights and Wizards, lead your followers in battle. Take enough devastation to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of your followers. Then take another portion, as much as you dare, and use it for your own purposes. But if it is too much, your peers will kill you and take it. Then tithe the remainder to the Ascendant you serve.<br/><br/>\nAn Ascendant will be those among the Hive who gather enough tribute to enter the netherworld. They will pay a tithe to those above them.<br/><br/>\nAnd thus the tribute will flow, up the chain, so that Savath&#251;n and Xivu Arath and myself will be fed by a great river of tribute, and we will use that excess to feed our gods, and to study the Deep. Thus all worms will be fed \u2014 as long as we continue our crusade.<br/><br/>\nThis is my law. I carve it thus, in ruin. Aiat.",
