    "cardDescription": "By now, Quria knows it can\u2019t win.<br/><br/>\nThere\u2019s something pathological about the world inside Oryx\u2019s ship. It resists analysis with hot, dead spite. And Oryx himself, he\u2019s irreducible \u2014 he refuses to obey Quria\u2019s simulations, he crashes around sowing chaos, he grabs subminds and compromises them with some kind of ontological weapon. Paracausal systems. Very problematic.<br/><br/>\nQuria\u2019s trying the religious tactics it evolved in the Hive manifold. But even on those terms, Oryx is strong, so strong. Quria won\u2019t be able to protect its gates much longer.<br/><br/>\nThe closest Quria\u2019s got to a simulation of Oryx is a best-guess bootstrap. It\u2019s wrong \u2014 Quria\u2019s sure of that, it\u2019s Oryx minus the symbiote organism, minus the wings and morphs, minus the weapon, minus the power. No good for anything.<br/><br/>\nQuria manifests that simulation anyway. Just to see what happens.<br/><br/>\nThe Taken King marches on Quria\u2019s Hydra-hull, armed with blade and magic, cloaked in ancient cloth, and the universe wails in horror around him. Quria\u2019s physics models and toy worlds choke and crash.<br/><br/>\nQuria observes, alert and attentive, as a single quark splits on the tip of Oryx\u2019s sword.<br/><br/>\nFrom within the Hydra-hull, Quria\u2019s tiny not-Oryx speaks. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d it says. It\u2019s manifesting terror and awe.<br/><br/>\nOryx\u2019s eyes blaze with a curiosity that is entirely isomorphic with hate, with voracious hunger. \u201cAurash,\u201d he says, in his Hive language. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me as I was. You\u2019ve made a tiny Aurash. Ha!\u201d<br/><br/>\nQuria updates the simulation\u2019s name. Aurash is curious: \u201cYou\u2019re me? You\u2019re me as I become?\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx kneels. His blade is on his left shoulder. Quria is firing every available weapon at him, but his wards don\u2019t break. He looks into Quria\u2019s sensors through the hammering fire and he says, \u201cChild, I have everything you wanted. I am immortal. I know the great secrets of the universe. I have scouted the edges of the Darkness and I have chased the lying god down galactic arms in a howling pack of moons. In my fist I carry the secret power that will rule eternity. In my worm I bear the tribute of my Court and of my children, the Hope-Eater, the Weaver, and the Unraveler; and with this tribute I smash my foes. I am Oryx, the Taken King. I am almighty.\u201d<br/><br/>\nQuria samples the Taox intelligence retrieved from the Ecumene gate. There are useful names. It feeds them to the simulation.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhat about your sisters?\u201d Aurash asks his future self. \u201cSathona? Xi Ro? Are they with you?\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Taken King\u2019s fangs glint. That sound might be a laugh, or a hiss.<br/><br/>\nQuria shuts down its weapons and puts all its spare resources into sending telemetry to the greater Vex. There will be points in space and time where this data is vital. There will be great projects undertaken in the study of this ontological power, this throne-space.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhere are my sisters?\u201d Aurash shouts. \u201cWhat have you done with my people? What have you done?\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut Oryx\u2019s fist is full of black fire, and the next thing Quria sees is a light like stars.",
