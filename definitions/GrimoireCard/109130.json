    "cardDescription": "Eris Morn is the sole survivor of an ill-fated raid on the Hive\u2019s lunar fortress. It was Eris and a rag-tag Fireteam who, after the first charge to take back the Moon, sacrificed everything to return in search of the one the Hive call Crota.<br/><br/>\nRobbed of her Ghost, Eris remained lost among the darkest shadows of the Hellmouth for countless cycles. Despite all odds she endured, using the very dark she battled to emerge a changed warrior\u2014driven, some would say obsessed. The Speaker and Commander Zavala find her compulsions a sickness, convinced she has been fully seduced by the shadows.<br/><br/>\nThough her warnings of Crota and his power are often dismissed as madness, Eris returns to the shadows time and time again, operating as one of Ikora Rey&#39;s Hidden\u2014a clandestine group of Guardians tasked with silently infiltrating enemy strongholds and gathering vital intel  for  the Warlocks.",
