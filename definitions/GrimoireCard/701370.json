    "cardDescription": "RECORD 0-CHASM-0<br/><br/>\nMy love. I\u2019ve opened this log as an apology.<br/><br/>\nAs a scientist, I believe in record-keeping. I believe in protocols, peer review, and ethical conduct. I believe in the importance of disbelief \u2014 you know: let\u2019s run that one more time.<br/><br/>\nWhat I\u2019m doing here in Lhasa isn\u2019t science. It\u2019s unethical, secret, and shameful. And after what happened in Ishtar, dearest Chioma, I know you\u2019d be furious with me for getting involved. Forty years isn\u2019t far enough to forget a day like that.<br/><br/>\nBut I believe it\u2019s important. The least I can do is keep a few notes for you.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-01<br/><br/>\nTrial one. Subject one. <br/><br/>\nIt was an act of stupid loneliness. I used the device on myself because I...<br/><br/>\n[silence: 0:08]<br/><br/>\nI missed you. We hadn\u2019t been apart for more than a year since we met. I\u2019m not a very good wife, am I? You write me every week, even with all Hyperion\u2019s work and all Hyperion\u2019s distance keeping you from me. And I act like it\u2019s not enough. <br/><br/>\nWe built the device in mimicry of the Vex gateway systems from Ishtar. An observatory, yes, but I think of it as a mind-ship. Capable of displacing its payload across space and time.<br/><br/>\nThe lab is cold and isolated. We are quarantined from the world, physically and mentally. We can\u2019t send messages out. If we breach the Vex manifolds, even our words might transmit contagion. One night last month I missed you and so I \u2014<br/><br/>\nI thought that I could look inside the device, and find one of the other Chiomas. I thought I could call out to one of the forks we sent out there to explore.<br/><br/>\nI just wanted to send my love.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-02<br/><br/>\nZakharik Gilmanovich Bekhterev. May he rest in peace. When our probes continued to fail, when my report remained our only positive finding, he volunteered to use the device. One minute of subjective experience inside.<br/><br/>\nWe took precautions. They worked. Bekhterev\u2019s experience left no physical damage.<br/><br/>\nAfter we extracted him, he said that he felt determined. I asked him what he meant and he said that he meant it, he had been determined, he could feel all his choices set out before him like a railroad. Deviation was impossible.<br/><br/>\nHe died by suicide. I wonder if he was trying to make a point.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-03<br/><br/>\nWe\u2019ve decided not to abort. It\u2019s insane, isn\u2019t it? There are pressures on us I can\u2019t tell you about until I see you again.<br/><br/>\nThe purpose of the system is intelligence, you see. It\u2019s stenciled right on the hull: SxISR.  Special asset. We would very much like to make it work reliably. <br/><br/>\nOur supervisory warmind has devised a drug it says will protect and prepare us.<br/><br/>\nI am beginning to wonder if we were wrong about the merchant and the alchemist. Or if that explanation of time was incomplete.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-09<br/><br/>\nKind Lakpha. He meditated before he went in. Nothing but d&#233;j&#224; vu and three seconds of screams. The screaming passed and he remembers nothing. The d&#233;j&#224; vu hasn\u2019t. He says it\u2019s getting better \u2014 he feels that we\u2019ve had this conversation only ten times before, not a thousand. <br/><br/>\nI\u2019ve suggested that we attempt mind forking. We need more sane people to work with. Please forgive me, my love.<br/><br/>\nWe are all growing superstitious. The behavior of the device is inconsistent. Impossible to replicate. We turn to ritual behavior to appease it.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-31<br/><br/>\nRajesh. When he reached a displacement of eight he told us he was dead. I believed him. He was dead. He spoke to us. It was true. Whatever he saw, it was his own future.<br/><br/>\nHe\u2019s fine, afterwards. When I look into his eyes I wonder what came back wearing his skin. But that thought is unscientific.<br/><br/>\nWe speak of nothing but the device. We talk about it like a demigod. When I get out of here I know the whole world will look like a fraying veil.<br/><br/>\nI think it\u2019s clear that part of the problem is substrate. We need more than flesh and drug to survive this.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-52<br/><br/>\nI heard you, my love. I was at six, oscillating on the event axis, coordinated with a known manifold. I heard you. You were talking to me \u2014 not me, but another me, another Maya Sundaresh.<br/><br/>\nYou said, my love, so many strange things have happened, and it\u2019s been so long. We\u2019ve come so far. Do you ever want to go home?<br/><br/>\nAnd I said, not me but the other me, I said, my love, I am always home.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019m resigning, my love. I\u2019m done with this work and I\u2019m done with being apart from you. I\u2019ll see you again soon. I can\u2019t take this journal out with me, so I\u2019ve left it for the others, and asked them to continue the log.<br/><br/>\nMaybe it\u2019ll become a tradition. The gospel of our little cult.",
