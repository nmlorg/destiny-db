    "cardDescription": "Okay, okay, I&#39;ll tell the story about that one Fallen.<br/><br/>\nIt didn&#39;t happen like that. We didn&#39;t, you know, do anything actively - no handshake, no icy stare of grudging mutual respect. I don&#39;t even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It must be complicated.<br/><br/>\nAnyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.<br/><br/>\nOf course I ran. <br/><br/>\nI had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost her crew.<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t really have time to shoot her and she didn&#39;t really have time to shoot me so we just went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.<br/><br/>\nFor a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I&#39;ll pass it over.<br/><br/>\nAt the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don&#39;t know if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn&#39;t howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.<br/><br/>\nWhen I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn&#39;t died easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.<br/><br/>\nI looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she&#39;d ended on those broken blades.<br/><br/>\nShe did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke her arms and opened her throat she didn&#39;t seem surprised.<br/><br/>\nTo this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me the choice.<br/><br/>\nI did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.",
