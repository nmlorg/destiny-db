    "cardDescription": "The man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, my third father and quite possibly my closest friend, came to Palamon from the south.<br/><br/>\nI was just a boy, but I&#39;ll never forget his silhouette on the empty trail as he made his slow walk into town.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d never seen anything like him. Maybe none of us had. He&#39;d said he was only passing through, and I believed him - still do, but life can get in the way of intent, and often does.<br/><br/>\nI can picture that day with near perfect clarity. Of all the details though - every nuance, every moment - the memory that sticks in my mind is the iron on Jaren&#39;s hip. A cannon that looked both pristine and lived in. Like a relic of every battle he&#39;d ever fought, hung low at his waist - a trophy and a warning.<br/><br/>\nThis man was dangerous, but there was a light about him - a pureness to his weight - that seemed to hint that his ire was something earned, not carelessly given.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d been the first to see him as he approached, but soon most of Palamon had turned out to greet him. My father held me back as everyone stood in silence.<br/><br/>\nJaren didn&#39;t make a sound behind his sleek racer&#39;s helmet. He looked just like the heroes in the stories, and to this day I&#39;m not sure one way or the other if the silence between the town&#39;s people and the adventurer was born of fear or respect. I like to think the latter, but any truth I try to place on the moment would be of my own making.<br/><br/>\nAs we waited for Magistrate Loken to arrive and make an official greeting, my patience got the best of me. I shook free of my father&#39;s heavy hand and made the short sprint across the court, stopping a few paces from where this new curiosity stood - a man unlike any other.<br/><br/>\nI stared up at him and he lowered his attention to me, his eyes hidden behind the thick tinted visor of his headgear. My sight quickly fell to his sidearm. I was transfixed by it. I imagined all the places that weapon had been. All of the wonders it had seen. The horrors it had endured. My imagination darted from one heroic act to the next.<br/><br/>\nI barely registered when he began to kneel, holding out the iron as if an offering. But my eyes locked onto the piece, mesmerized. <br/><br/>\nI recall turning back to my father and seeing the looks on the faces of everyone I knew. There was worry there - my father slowly shaking his head as if pleading with me to ignore the gift. <br/><br/>\nI turned back to the man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, the finest Hunter this system may ever know and one of the greatest Guardians to ever defend the Traveler&#39;s Light...<br/><br/>\nAnd I took the weapon in my hand. Carefully. Gently.<br/><br/>\nNot to use. But to observe. To imagine. To feel its weight and know its truth.<br/><br/>\nThat was the first time I held &quot;Last Word,&quot; but, unfortunately, not the last.",
