    "cardDescription": "ARENA DESIGNATION: Exodus Blue<br/>\nLOCATION: Cosmodrome, Earth<br/><br/>\nGrimly referred to as &quot;The Graveyard,&quot; Exodus Blue was only recently secured for Crucible combat. Located among the ruins of one of the Cosmodrome&#39;s colony ship gantries, this site is a memorial to the grief and horror of the Collapse. Thousands died here in a last-ditch effort to outrun the oncoming Darkness. <br/><br/>\nBut it is also a sign of hope. Once the Cosmodrome is secure, the great colony ships may fly again. And this location was chosen specifically to send a message to the Fallen House of Devils - &quot;You may be picking at the bones of our history, but we are still here, and we are still strong.&quot;",
