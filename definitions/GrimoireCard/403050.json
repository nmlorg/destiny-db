    "cardDescription": "Skyscape fresco of smart crystals and pigments in a ceiling of Vestan plaster and diamond ribbing. <br/><br/>\nApparent size: 14.4 x 3.55 x .022 meters<br/><br/>\nParticipants witness images set in an undetermined orbital habit. 5 to 77 images are generated per participant. The quantity seems insensitive to the participant&#39;s time of exposure.<br/><br/>\nParticipants experience strong intuitions. Modal self-reports include:<br/><br/>\nAn electric sense of belonging to a cause.<br/><br/>\nThe intuition that a pivotal truth is about to be delivered. <br/><br/>\nA persistent foreboding that lingers for days to years.<br/><br/>\nAmorphous grief.<br/><br/>\nAgape love.<br/><br/>\nOutlier reports include the hum of wind, the scent of lilacs, changes in apparent gravity, the ability to sing perfectly, and the perception of flesh as transparent.<br/><br/>\nOne corner was damaged during the move to the present location, affording a glimpse into the work&#39;s interior. Key materials have not been identified, but there is evidence that the fresco ties into quantum computers set in a parallel dimension or on a distant world. <br/><br/>\nThe work appears to be unfinished.",
