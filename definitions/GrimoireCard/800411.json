    "cardDescription": "Perun stood at the top of a sloping, narrow path cut into a steep plateau. It was not yet dawn, and the valley below her was foggy and dark.<br/><br/>\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not coming.\u201d This from a thin woman at Perun\u2019s side, the mayor of the crumbling silvery ruins on the plateau behind them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want you wolves here. Lord Segoth knows that.\u201d<br/><br/>\nIn answer, Perun pointed into the valley. A red light had appeared.<br/><br/>\nThe mayor let out a wail. &quot;Segoth will kill us all. Or worse, he&#39;ll leave us to the Fallen.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun shook her head. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d <br/><br/>\nThe mayor looked at Perun and the two Titans standing on her other side. Then she turned and ran back into the village. <br/><br/>\nThe red lights were larger; already the faint, choppy whine of repaired Pikes filled their ears. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Nine of them,&quot; said Saladin.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNine, nine hundred, they still gotta come up the pass three at a time.\u201d She cracked her knuckles. \u201cEasy pickins.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRadegast looked at her. &quot;The north and south roads are undefended. If they change course\u2014&quot;<br/><br/>\n\u201cThey won&#39;t.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s about making people afraid\u2014 of Segoth, and of us. Seeing his goons coming a ways off, knowing he&#39;s coming for blood... the dread is part of the punishment. Anyway, he doesn&#39;t expect we&#39;ll still be here. So he takes the west road, &#39;cause it&#39;s the most visible, and the most direct.&quot;<br/><br/>\nRadegast frowned. &quot;Then it&#39;s time to show Segoth that his tyranny will end.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Not just Segoth,&quot; said Perun. She jerked a thumb toward the ruins behind her. Watchful faces poked out of windows and around tarps. &quot;We gotta show them.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe three of them picked up large, rough-hewn metal shields. Behind their shields, each held a worn rifle, wrapped with cloth and chain mail.<br/><br/>\nThe Pike-riders&#39; faces were now visible through early morning gloom. A man in long red robes pulled his Pike ahead as they screeched to a halt.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Segoth. \u201cThe Iron Wolves.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cCease your insults,\u201d Saladin barked. <br/><br/>\nPerun shot him a surprised look. \u201cThat\u2019s an insult? I kinda like \u2018Wolves.\u2019\u201d<br/><br/>\n&quot;Begone, wolves,\u201d Segoth sneered. \u201cThese people are mine.\u201d<br/><br/>\n&quot;Wrong,&quot; Radegast retorted. &quot;You abuse the powers the Traveler has entrusted us.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSegoth smiled, and shrugged.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Shields up!&quot; Perun shouted.<br/><br/>\nA hail of bullets slammed into their shields. Perun, Radegast, and Saladin slid backwards on the dusty path. But they dug in their heels, and the shields held. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Return fire!&quot;<br/><br/>\nTrapped in the narrow path, Segoth and his warriors fell one by one. <br/><br/>\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin reloaded and then Segoth was up again, his glowing Ghost at his shoulder. He fired wildly, and a bullet struck Radegast in the head. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Got him!&quot; Perun shouted as Radegast collapsed.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Covering you!&quot; Saladin returned. <br/><br/>\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin died many more times than any one of Segoth&#39;s men. But any time one of them fell, another would cover them until they staggered to their feet again. The shield wall held. The three gave no ground. <br/><br/>\nFinally, his robes singed and ragged, Segoth signaled a retreat. <br/><br/>\n\u201cIron Wolves!\u201d he shouted as his warriors scattered and a cheer went up from the people in the silver ruins. \u201cI will slaughter everyone who has ever sheltered you!&quot;<br/><br/>\nIn answer, Perun shot him again.",
