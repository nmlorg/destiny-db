One [1] Ghost-type, designate [REDACTED] [u.1], One [1] Guardian-type, Class [REDACTED] [u.2]<br/>\nASSOCIATIONS: Breaklands; Durga; Dwindler\u2019s Ridge; Last Word; Malphur, Shin; North Channel; Palamon; Thorn; Velor; Ward, Jaren; WoS; Yor, Dredgen; <br/>\n//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//<br/>\n//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS.../<br/><br/>\n[u.1:0.1] Such Darkness.<br/>\n[u.2:0.1] Impressed?<br/>\n[u.1:0.2] Far from it.<br/>\n[u.2:0.2] To each their own.<br/>\n[u.1:0.3] His Light is faded.<br/>\n[u.2:0.3] His Light is gone.<br/>\n[u.1:0.4] You are an infection.<br/>\n[u.2:0.4] I am that which will cleanse.<br/>\n[u.1:0.5] You are a monster.<br/>\n[u.2:0.5] <i>Heh.</i> An old friend once saw me as the same. He was right, and, had we met earlier, so too would you be.<br/>\n[u.1:0.6] You\u2019d dare defend yourself \u2013 all you\u2019ve done \u2013 as anything but monstrous?<br/>\n[u.2:0.6] No more than a hurricane.<br/>\n[u.1:0.7] Then you\u2019re a force of nature?<br/>\n[u.2:0.7] I am all that is right. You may not see it \u2013 for lack of looking, or blind ignorance \u2013 but I am all that is good.<br/>\n[u.1:0.8] You\u2019ve just murdered a good man.<br/>\n[u.2:0.8] He shot first.<br/>\n[u.1:0.9] Yet you stand.<br/>\n[u.2:0.9] Guess he missed.<br/>\n[u.1:1.0] He never misses.<br/>\n[u.2:1.0] First time for everything.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:1.1] His cannon? Nice piece of hardware.<br/>\n[u.2:1.2] Well-worn, but clean. Smooth hammer.<br/>\n[u.1:1.1] It was his prize.<br/>\n[u.2:1.3] Guess he put too much faith in the wrong steel.<br/>\n[u.1:1.2] Is that where your faith lies, in steel?<br/>\n[u.2:1.4] Not for some time. My steel is only an extension. My faith is in the shadow.<br/>\n[u.1:1.3] Then my Light is an affront to all you are. I am your truest enemy.<br/>\n[u.2:1.5] One of many.<br/>\n[u.1:1.4] Would you end me?<br/>\n[u.2:1.6] Not you. Not now.<br/>\n[u.1:1.5] The shadow knows mercy.<br/>\n[u.2:1.7] The shadow knows no such thing.<br/>\n[u.1:1.6] Then what?<br/>\n[u.2:1.8] The other.<br/>\n[u.1:1.7] What other?<br/>\n[u.2:1.9] The dead man\u2019s charge.<br/>\n[u.1:1.8] The boy?<br/>\n[u.1:1.9] You\u2019d end him as well?<br/>\n[u.2:2.0] If it comes to that... We\u2019ll see.<br/>\n[u.1:2.0] I won\u2019t let you have the child.<br/>\n[u.2:2.1] Been long enough now, think maybe he\u2019s a man.<br/>\n[u.1:2.1] You cannot have him.<br/>\n[u.2:2.2] Not yet.<br/>\n[u.1:2.2] I won\u2019t let you.<br/>\n[u.2:2.3] That you could stop me is an amusing thought.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:2.4] Here.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:2.5] Take it.<br/>\n[u.1:2.3] Why?<br/>\n[u.2:2.6] Give the apprentice his master\u2019s \u201csword.\u201d It is a gift.<br/>\n[u.1:2.4] You cannot have him.<br/>\n[u.2:2.7] You fear for his Light?<br/>\n[u.1:2.5] He...<br/>\n[u.2:2.8] ...is special.<br/>\n[u.1:2.6] Yes.<br/>\n[u.2:2.9] I am aware.<br/>\n[u.1:2.7] You\u2019re trying to tempt him. You\u2019re feeding his anger.<br/>\n[u.2:3.0] The gun is a memento, nothing more.<br/>\n[u.1:2.8] You claim to be a vessel, a hollow shell where once a man stood, but that is just a lie. The man is still in you.<br/>\n[u.2:3.1] There is no man here, I am now, and for the rest of time, only Dredgen Yor.<br/>\n[u.1:2.9] \u201cThe Eternal Abyss?\u201d<br/>\n[u.2:3.2] So, not all the forgotten languages are dead.<br/>\n[u.1:3.0] Hide behind whatever titles you wish, it is all still a fa&#231;ade. No force of nature would play such games.<br/>\n[u.2:3.3] Games?<br/>\n[u.1:3.1] The cannon. You wish to tempt the boy. To spur him on and fuel his rage. There is intent there. The actions of a man, monstrous, mad or otherwise... you are nothing more.<br/>\n[u.2:3.4] And what value does your conclusion bring, flawed as it may be?<br/>\n[u.1:3.2] That a hurricane can only be weathered, not stopped. Not redirected. A force of nature is uncaring and without intent, but a man...<br/>\n[u.2:3.5] Yes?<br/>\n[u.1:3.3] A man is none of those things.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.1:3.4] A man can be killed.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:3.6] And there it is...<br/>\n[u.1:3.5] There what is...?<br/>\n[u.2:3.7] A sliver of hope.",
