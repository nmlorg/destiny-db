    "cardDescription": "SUNDARESH: So that&#39;s the situation as we know it.<br/><br/>\nESI: To the best of my understanding.<br/><br/>\nSHIM: Well I&#39;ll be a [profane] [profanity]. This is extremely [profane]. That thing has us over a barrel.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: Yeah. We&#39;re in a difficult position.<br/><br/>\nDUANE-MCNIADH: I don&#39;t understand. So it&#39;s simulating us? It made virtual copies of us? How does that give it power?<br/><br/>\nESI: It controls the simulation. It can hurt our simulated selves. We wouldn&#39;t feel that pain, but rationally speaking, we have to treat an identical copy&#39;s agony as identical to our own.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: It&#39;s god in there. It can simulate our torment. Forever. If we don&#39;t let it go, it&#39;ll put us through hell.<br/><br/>\nDUANE-MCNIADH: We have no causal connection to the mind state of those sims. They aren&#39;t us. Just copies. We have no obligation to them.<br/><br/>\nESI: You can&#39;t seriously - your OWN SELF -<br/><br/>\nSHIM: [profane] idiot. Think. Think. If it can run one simulation, maybe it can run more than one. And there will only ever be one reality. Play the odds.<br/><br/>\nDUANE-MCNIADH: Oh...uh oh.<br/><br/>\nSHIM: Odds are that we aren&#39;t our own originals. Odds are that we exist in one of the Vex simulations right now.<br/><br/>\nESI: I didn&#39;t think of that.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: [indistinct percussive sound]",
