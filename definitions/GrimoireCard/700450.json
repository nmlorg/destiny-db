    "cardDescription": "Dearest Guardian,<br/><br/>\nI write to you from a place of high contempt. No no no, don\u2019t be offended, don\u2019t be so superficial \u2014 it\u2019s in the architecture of these spaces. They look down on you.<br/><br/>\nI wander out here, in worlds cut by sharp Hive swords, and I send back these messages for you.<br/><br/>\nOf Oryx, that admirable monarch, I have only a little to say. Why? Because He is all in the action, fellow traveler, His philosophy is all on display. He has twinned himself so closely to the power He admires. He has become many-placed, many-formed, sending out emissaries of himself to ask after the truth.<br/><br/>\nIn each act of His power Oryx seeks to incarnate the self-sustaining, immortal suzerainty that He worships. The power that He uses to wash his Taken clean and etch them into useful shapes.<br/><br/>\nLISTEN! LISTEN! Understand, you simpleton, it\u2019s <i>entirely obvious</i> \u2014<br/><br/>\nOryx inhabits a world where power is truth. To win is to be noble, and to be real. When He departs from that world, out into the material universe, He is lessened.<br/><br/>\nThe echoes of Oryx go forth to ask a question: are you the truth? And that means \u2014 well. You see, I\u2019m sure.",
