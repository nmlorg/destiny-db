    "cardDescription": "For life, Sathona dove. For vengeance, Xi Ro dove. And Aurash dove to understand.<br/><br/>\nThe needle ship pierced the skin of the world and burrowed deep. Through layers of foam and metal and cold elemental slush. Aurash devoured the ship\u2019s maps of Fundament, from the high angelic cloud decks, down and down through storms and oceans and plates of floating world, into the crush of the core.<br/><br/>\nThey met monsters of continental scope. Vast anemones that raised glowing tentacles to bait them in. Xi Ro flew the needle ship through them and they bled black carbon jelly and frost.<br/><br/>\nThey came to a still place, beneath a plate of metal.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the sensors,\u201d whispered Aurash. \u201cListen...\u201d<br/><br/>\nIn the wet gold dark of the helm, they listened to the ship, and the ship listened to the crushing motions of Fundament.<br/><br/>\nThey heard the collision of continents. They heard the patter and the crash of helium-neon rain. They heard the struggles of monsters. And they heard the distant groan of the ocean rising. Tugged by distant moons.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe syzygy is real...\u201d Sathona hissed. \u201cIt\u2019s already begun.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBehind them, Xi Ro thought of the birthing-room, where ancient explorers had labored over surgeries and administrations, peeling back the chrysalis and the caul of that which they had made from the deep, whose birth none of them would survive...<br/><br/>\n\u201cThere\u2019s something down here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSomething secret.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAnd the Leviathan loomed over them, its brow as huge all the continents of their childhood, its great array-fins crackling with the lightning of its life. Booming into the hull of the needle ship in a microwave voice:<br/><br/>\n++YOU MUST TURN BACK\u2014<br/>\n\u2014SAVE YOURSELVES FROM THE DEEP++<br/>\n++SAVE THE WORLD FROM YOURSELVES\u2014<br/>\n\u2014YOU MUST TURN BACK++",
