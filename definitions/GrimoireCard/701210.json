    "cardDescription": "You are a Knight. Ancient warrior elite. Dreadful backbone of the Hive. You have scarred entire worlds.<br/><br/>\nYou have been taken.<br/><br/>\nSet down your sword. Put down your boomer. The fight is not yet begun. True immortality awaits you.<br/><br/>\nWhat vows compel you? What drives you down the long centuries?<br/><br/>\nYou fear death. Even as you visit nothingness on your foes, even as you gather tribute from your acolytes, you know that one day your strength will be outmatched. And your centuries of slaughter will end. So you practice your guard: you call up walls to protect you.<br/><br/>\nYou betray the sword logic. You compromise the totality of your violence. Why protect your ground when you could take the enemy\u2019s? <br/><br/>\nYou need to make your guard into a weapon.<br/><br/>\nThere is a knife for you. It is shaped like [no more fear].<br/><br/>\nTake up the knife. Hide no more. Take your new shape.",
