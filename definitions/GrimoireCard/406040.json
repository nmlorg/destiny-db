    "cardDescription": "We want your grandchildren.<br/><br/>\nDoes that sound grim? Don&#39;t panic. We aren&#39;t talking about human babies, yours or anyone else&#39;s. We&#39;re talking about your inventions. The children of your mind.<br/><br/>\nCome join us. Come to Clovis Bray and build the laboratory of your dreams. Anything you need. Demand it and it&#39;s yours. At Clovis Bray, we have a singular understanding of genius, and we appreciate how brilliant minds flourish when they enjoy total freedom.<br/><br/>\nThis is Freehold, the realm where the new and the best is born. This is where your brilliance, freed of budget constraints and managers, makes the universe dance.<br/><br/>\nClovis Bray is a nursery, a nursery to a million marvels. Your inventions belong to no one but you. Cherish them, praise them. Or tell them they aren&#39;t worthy and set them inside a deep dark drawer.<br/><br/>\nBut as every parent soon learns, children grow up. And every technology matures. At some point, your inventions are going to find mates. They&#39;ll join with other marvels and produce a new generation of offspring.<br/><br/>\nMaybe you&#39;ll build a better reactor.<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile, the genius in the lab next door devises an elegant way to fold machines into tiny spaces.<br/><br/>\nYour device meets hers, and a fierce little reactor is born.<br/><br/>\nYour children are yours forever. And we are happy to arrange for their grandchildren to prosper.",
