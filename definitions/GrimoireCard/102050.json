    "cardDescription": "Everybody asks about the words.<br/><br/>\nThe truth is I&#39;m not much of a poet. Ares One didn&#39;t leave us with bandwidth for anything except blunt competence. We came in perilously hot, trying to select a landing site through the chaos of thickening atmosphere and turbulence that bloomed off the target. A twenty minute round-trip lightspeed delay to Earth meant we could only count on ourselves.<br/><br/>\nWhen the number three engine went diagnostic during the second course correction, I thought we might go catastrophic.<br/><br/>\nBut Qiao brought us in. Mihaylova brought us in. I just flew the ship.<br/><br/>\nThe Ares One excursion vehicle was built for thin winds and icy dust. We came down into a storm: the breath of God, a ripple of change rolling down off the artifact. We aborted on three sites and finally I took us into powered hover and brought us down on reflexes and instinct.<br/><br/>\nThen we ran the checklists, suited up, and left the vehicle.<br/><br/>\nThere was a script, and it&#39;s true, I botched it. I got my boots down and I made the most famous gaffe in human history. Said the first thing that came to mind: a warning to the others.<br/><br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re walking into a rising wind.&quot;<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean to say anything immortal. I just thought it&#39;d be useful to know.",
