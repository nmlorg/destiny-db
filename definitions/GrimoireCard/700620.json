It represents many hundreds of failed operations.<br/><br/>\nGuardian activity in the Freehold AO has exploded across recent campaign seasons. Tactical attrition exceeds both frictional projections and our ability to regenerate losses. New tactics are necessary.    <br/><br/>\nThe primary threat is the Guardians\u2019 individual counter-attrition capability. <br/><br/>\nGuardians can be rebuilt after even total disintegrative trauma. This capability is provided by a small autonomous drone unit called a Dead Person [trans. unclear]. The Dead Person conceals itself during combat. It is not a viable target for direct fire. Saturation attack by artillery/heavy air/orbital fire may have good effect (although Guardians transmat frequently and refuse to assemble into large formations).<br/><br/>\nSolitary Dead Persons have been observed in all areas of operation. The relationship between solitary and paired Dead Persons remains unclear.<br/><br/>\nPsion analysis indicates that specific areas are inimicable to Guardian counter-attritional reconstruction. Phobos Command has initiated an orbital survey. BL I/2 will attack the Vex gate artifact in Meridian Bay to secure possible related intelligence.<br/><br/>\nFlayer analysis suggests that the Hive have developed unconventional counter-Dead Person capability. The capture of Hive leadership might yield vital strategic intelligence, including weapons or tactics capable of defeating Guardians permanently.<br/><br/>\nWe advance that the Hive fleet group near Saturn presents a strong target.<br/><br/>\nFor the Primus,<br/>\nOur highest duty done,<br/>\nUnflinchingly loyal,<br/>\nSkyburner V/A/SI",
