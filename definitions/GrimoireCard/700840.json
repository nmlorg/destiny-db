    "cardDescription": "You are dead, young Auryx. Betrayed and murdered by your own sister, for the crime of mercy.<br/><br/>\nRemember what you said to the Ammonite Satellite Congress? \u2018We will parley on neutral ground?\u2019 Savath&#251;n\u2019s witches have rendered it utterly neutral. No living thing will ever claim it again. The space around the dry moon stinks of rot.<br/><br/>\nThis is good. This is right. You will learn from this. Don\u2019t you understand, great King? Don\u2019t you want to build something real, something that lasts forever?<br/><br/>\nOur universe gutters down towards cold entropy. Life is an engine that burns up energy and produces decay. Life builds selfish, stupid rules \u2014 morality is one of them, and the sanctity of life is another.<br/><br/>\nThese rules are impediments to the great work. The work of building a perfect, undying creation, a civilization everlasting. Something that cannot end.<br/><br/>\nIf a civilization cannot defend itself, it must be annihilated. If a King cannot hold his power, he must be betrayed. The worth of a thing can be determined only by one beautiful arbiter \u2014 that thing\u2019s ability to exist, to go on existing, to remake existence to suit its survival.<br/><br/>\nAll that would oppose this arbiter is unholy and false. All the misery and terror of your ancestors springs from the lies of the Sky, who deny this truth.<br/><br/>\nYour ancestors endured the most hostile conditions. And now you must go on creating those conditions. Even unto your sisters. Even unto your offspring. Savath&#251;n\u2019s betrayal is the greatest gift she could offer you.<br/><br/>\nYour body is gone, but you have endured. Safe in the cyst universe created by your own might \u2014 your throne world.<br/><br/>\nFrom this day forward, Auryx, you and your sisters will each survive death \u2014 so long as you aren\u2019t killed in your own throne.<br/><br/>\nEven as your sisters press the attack against the Ammonites, the God-Wave devastates Fundament. Trillions will die. But the survivors will never forget... and their descendants will always be ready for another syzygy.<br/><br/>\nWhen you return to the material universe, use this lesson to complete your work.<br/><br/>\nTaox wasn\u2019t on the dry moon. She must be laughing at you.",
