By war\u2019s end, they&#39;d fought all the way to the ship\u2019s \u201cimpossible weapon,\u201d the Dark ordnance that obliterated the Awoken fleet.<br/><br/>\nIt was there they found what the Warlocks named the \u201cCathedral of Dusk.\u201d A Hive burial site for\u2014 what? A former master of Oryx? Comrade? Lover? It was vile. And obvious that Oryx never expected the Light to reach so deep inside his throne, to such an intimate space. But he didn\u2019t expect a lot of things \u2014 like a Guardian training ground atop the husk of his dead ship.",
