    "cardDescription": "One day Oryx decided to grow new wings. While he wrestled with his worm, he came upon his twin daughters dying in a wound between places.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhat are you doing, my daughters?\u201d he asked. He was afraid that Ir Halak and Ir An&#251;k were trying to go into the Deep, where only the Tablets of Ruin allowed Oryx to go.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe are dying, father,\u201d they said. \u201cAs many times as we can manage.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s adorably precocious.\u201d Oryx shook out his new wings. \u201cBut why?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe propose a method by which Ascendant souls can be detached and integrated into a tautological and autonomous thanatosphere, which we tentatively term an oversoul. Oversouls can be stored in a throne world as a mechanism of enhanced death resilience. As a side effect, new refinements to our Deathsong may be achieved, moving us closer to a generally effective paracausal death impulse.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx brandished his sword. \u201cSpeak the Royal Tongue, or I\u2019ll pin you up for Eir to eat.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIf we can separate our deaths from ourselves, and hide them, we will be hard to kill.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx went to his son, Crota. \u201cGo keep an eye on your sisters,\u201d he said. \u201c&#39;You can learn cunning from them.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut while Oryx traveled to observe the Deep destroy an ancient fortress world, Crota conspired with his sisters to learn their secrets. \u201cI too will experiment with a wound,\u201d he said. With his sword Crota cut open a new wound, into a new space. In here he thought he might obtain a secret power.<br/><br/>\nOut of this wound came machines called Vex. They invaded Oryx\u2019s throne world.",
