    "cardDescription": "A register of tokens and gestures exchanged before the end of sisterhood.<br/><br/>\n\u201cXi Ro, my brave sister, you have worked too hard to move the carcasses out of the birthing room! Come. Steer the ship for a while. Take joy in what our needle can do.\u201d<br/><br/>\nXi Ro tried to protest, but secretly, she was so glad for Aurash\u2019s care. She flew the needle ship in cutting circles, down beneath the sea: and their wake rose up to the surface like a traitor\u2019s dying breath.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAurash, lonely navigator, we have traveled so long with only each other. I know you love to hear and speak new tongues. Come, sit in the flesh garden room. I will read you these stories I bought at Kaharn.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAurash sat among the mummified flesh fans with two of her eyes closed and listened in silence to Sathona\u2019s stories, hungry to understand, voracious to know as much as she could before her ten year life died.<br/><br/>\nLater, Xi Ro said, \u201cSathona, cutting mind of ours, you grow lonely in your thought. Play swords and lanterns with me!\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut Sathona was heavy with sorrow, and couldn\u2019t pretend any joy as she chased Xi Ro through the needle\u2019s glistening halls.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSathona, pensive one, what is it? What troubles you?\u201d<br/><br/>\nHer sisters listened as Sathona said \u201cOath-bearing siblings, we are five years old. For two years we\u2019ve worked to repair this ancient ship and understand its systems. I am almost too old for the mother jelly, and the knights who killed our father are surely dying of age.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe three will die here, in exile. Taox will outlive us. And Aurash, brilliant-eyed Aurash, you will die of old age long before you have proof of your God-Wave, or any way to stop it.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAurash and Xi Ro looked at each other. \u201cI wish you weren\u2019t so honest,\u201d Xi Ro said. And Aurash thought that Sathona had never been wrong.<br/><br/>\nIn her soul Aurash knew that the only way to keep their oath was to find a great, powerful secret. A secret that could change everything. This was Aurash\u2019s soul, her fire and her shadow \u2014 her desire to cut through the flank of the world and find its beating heart.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe have to dive,\u201d Aurash said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this ship is built to do. Dive into the Fundament, the world below us... towards the core.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the ancient crew died so obscenely,\u201d Xi Ro protested. \u201cThat\u2019s where the atrocity in the birthing room was born...\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe have to dive,\u201d Sathona said, following the whispers of her familiar. \u201cIn the world beneath us, in the metallic depths, I hope we may find what we need most...\u201d<br/><br/>\nMore time. More life.",
