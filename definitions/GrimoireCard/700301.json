Or even when the events described by the writer take place.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThis particular engram is heavily degraded. Encoded Mid-Golden Age, allegedly written by someone named Plutarch, a historian who in turn is writing about someone named Fabius Maximus. But who were they? When did they live? In what kind of warfare was this &#39;Fabian Strategy&#39; applied?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe whatnow strategy?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cFabian Strategy. It apparently involves attrition tactics and avoiding direct conflict until an enemy makes a mistake.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201c...Huh.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201c&#39;Huh&#39; indeed!\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201c...But with Ghost res\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\n\u201cOh, this was long before Ghosts. I think... Banshee? Where are you going?\u201d",
