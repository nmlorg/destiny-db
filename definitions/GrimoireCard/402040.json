    "cardDescription": "The box appears to be copper.<br/><br/>\nThe red lid is dented, one hinge shattered.<br/><br/>\nInside waits a small quantity of the finest, driest powder, more brown than gray, more blue than green.<br/><br/>\nThe greatest minds in creation make quick work of the material. The powder is weighed by the grain, and studied close, and remembered. One hundred billion bits of near-nothing reside inside the copper box, all of them tiny and nearly spherical, all etched with the outlines of continents and islands and icecaps. Each sphere represents a planet, and some of these tiny globes match known worlds.<br/><br/>\nThere is one Earth and one Mars and a Venus too.<br/><br/>\nThe box holds renderings of every habitable world in the galaxy. <br/><br/>\nOne of them offers a simple explanation:<br/><br/>\n&quot;The box is a message. The message is the minuscule nature of the box&#39;s cargo. It&#39;s the image of one hundred billion worlds barely filling two hands.&quot;<br/><br/>\nBut if so, who is delivering this message? What vastness do they wish to impress on us? Is it a warning, or an invitation, or a taunt?",
