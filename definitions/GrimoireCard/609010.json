    "cardDescription": "ARENA DESIGNATION: The Burning Shrine<br/>\nLOCATION: Fields of Glass, Mercury<br/><br/>\nThis clockwork impossibility is but one small conduit in a vast network, extending throughout the dead planet&#39;s core. <br/><br/>\nThe unknown energies and complex mechanics of the Shrine have been studied and mapped by the curious, yet its purpose remains a mystery. The only truth that can be agreed upon is that the structure is intimately tied to the past, and future, of one of our greatest enemies - the Vex.<br/><br/>\nThe Shrine has been claimed as a battleground for the Crucible in an effort to familiarize Guardians with both Vex architecture and the otherworldly energies that signal their presence. Having a constant flow of combat-ready Guardians on hand should the Shrine ever achieve a higher functionality is simply a strategic byproduct of the Crucible&#39;s presence.",
