    "cardDescription": "General Chen Lanshu is flying her glider.<br/><br/>\nShe carves around the huge bulb nose of a colony ship, one of the Cosmodrome\u2019s towering children.  Her eyes see temperature: she surfs the winter air rolling down off the cryo-chilled fuel tank.  Turbulence rattles her bones.<br/><br/>\n\u201cGeneral,\u201d Malahayati sends. \u201cYou\u2019re making Rasputin nervous.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAm I?\u201d Lanshu banks, grinning, spiraling around the fuel tank.  The machine hates risk.  Risk to the General, sure, but also risk to Rasputin\u2019s ships.  \u201cIs that the word he used, exactly?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe can be very charming,\u201d the submind assures her.  Malahayati works with Chen Lanshu, and she is certainly charming, but this is Rasputin\u2019s territory, Rasputin the tacit king, the brooding wary first-among-equals.<br/><br/>\nYesterday Lanshu spoke to a colony ship AI and it called Rasputin \u2018the Tyrant.\u2019  Not without affection.  And certainly not without respect.<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe can charm me in person,\u201d Lanshu suggests.<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe\u2019s very private, lately.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThen he can sulk.\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe spreads her arms and legs and climbs a thermal, whirling up, arrowing off the top and out away from the colony ships towards the defensive wall.  Her glider\u2019s a second skin, whipcrack-taut paramuscle, like a flying fox.<br/><br/>\nThe Cosmodrome races past beneath her.  She waggles her wings at a cloud of passing sensor mites: a saucy hello.  Two of the security division\u2019s MBTs drill in the mothyards.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you came,\u201d Malahayati says.  She\u2019s probably lying. Malahayati understands Lanshu very, very well.  \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you masked yourself yesterday, during the launch.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe launch.  SABER GREEN.  Rasputin quietly moving another doomsday weapon into Earth orbit.  And all the other launches, too, not just weapons but people, the colonization schedule pushed up... as if the need to disperse is now imperative.<br/><br/>\nGeneral Chen Lanshu banks out across the Wall.  Look at all that beauty!  Look at the highway rolling off across green hills and grey mountains.  Imagine, now, imagine if she just landed and started walking, out away from everything, into the wilderness...<br/><br/>\n\u201cImagine something going wrong,\u201d she says.  \u201cImagine this road choked with corpses. Imagine the security team gunning down refugees as they try to force their way onto the ships. Imagine cars from here to the horizon\u2014 \u201d those stupid old-fashioned cars everyone still owns, because the strange uneven advancement of this post-Traveler world leaves some things unchanged.<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou expect violence?\u201d Malahayati says, in that conciliatory, careful way of hers, her way of managing meat people.  \u201cSomething beyond our capability to preempt or contain?\u201d<br/><br/>\nExpect? As a military professional? No, no. But\u2014<br/><br/>\nOnce, when she was younger, sixty or seventy, Chen Lanshu pulled rank to get a look at the Never-Be installation in Taipei.  She watched the images in the fresco and she felt... this foreboding, this enormous weight, a dread that refused to attach itself to any specific threat.  And she felt it again, last year, when she was briefed on the project in Lhasa, the vision machine...<br/><br/>\nShe shivers.  Her wings shudder and tremble in the airstream.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what we do, Mala?\u201d she says. \u201cWhy we still have soldiers? Why we made you? Expectation.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Traveler came out of nowhere.  Entirely unanticipated.<br/><br/>\nImagine if it hadn\u2019t been friendly.  Imagine that.<br/><br/>\nRasputin surely has.",
