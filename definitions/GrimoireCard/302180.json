One [1] Ghost-type, designate [REDACTED] [u.1], One [1] Guardian-type, Class [REDACTED] [u.2]<br/>\nASSOCIATIONS: [REDACTED]; Breaklands; Durga; Last Word; Malphur, Shin; North Channel; Palamon; Thorn; Velor; Ward, Jaren; WoS; Yor, Dredgen; <br/>\n//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//<br/>\n//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS.../<br/><br/>\n[u.1:0.1] You were not always this man.<br/>\n[u.2:0.1] True.<br/>\n[u.1:0.2] Then the math says you do not need to remain this man. You can be other.<br/>\n[u.2:0.2] I am other.<br/>\n[u.1:0.3] You can be better.<br/>\n[u.2:0.3] This is better.<br/>\n[u.1:0.4] That matter, at best, is subjective.<br/>\n[u.2:0.4] Then what? Lesser.<br/>\n[u.1:0.5] Some would say.<br/>\n[u.2:0.5] But what would you say?<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:0.6] All we\u2019ve seen and now, here with me, you have no words.<br/>\n[u.1:0.6] I have words.<br/>\n[u.2:0.7] But...?<br/>\n[u.1:0.7] But you will not like them.<br/>\n[u.2:0.8] There is much I do not like.<br/>\n[u.1:0.8] More now than ever it would seem.<br/>\n[u.2:0.9] Heh.<br/>\n[u.1:0.9] I find no laughing matter in your path.<br/>\n[u.2:1.0] Only in the journey.<br/>\n[u.1:1.0] What brought you here was nobility.<br/>\n[u.2:1.1] And my prize.<br/>\n[u.1:1.1] That is no prize.<br/>\n[u.2:1.2] A curse then?<br/>\n[u.1:1.2] I would say.<br/>\n[u.2:1.3] And I would disagree.<br/>\n[u.1:1.3] You are no longer yourself.<br/>\n[u.2:1.4] I am myself. It\u2019s who I was that\u2019s gone.<br/>\n[u.1:1.4] Who you were held all the value.<br/>\n[u.2:1.5] To you.<br/>\n[u.1:1.5] To the Light.<br/>\n[u.2:1.6] The Light...<br/>\n[u.1:1.6] It is all.<br/>\n[u.2:1.7] It is nothing but a crutch.<br/>\n[u.1:1.7] One that has held you up.<br/>\n[u.2:1.8] Only just. And nothing more.<br/>\n[u.1:1.8] Nothing more? You were a hero.<br/>\n[u.2:1.9] And yet people still die. Corruption still exists. Light still fades. And Darkness still spreads.<br/>\n[u.1:1.9] As it will ever be, that doesn\u2019t mean you give in to...<br/>\n[u.2:2.0] To what? Hope.<br/>\n[u.1:2.0] This is not hope.<br/>\n[u.2:2.1] This is peace.<br/>\n[u.1:2.1] You have blood on your hands.<br/>\n[u.2:2.2] How\u2019s that any different than prior?<br/>\n[u.1:2.2] Innocent blood.<br/>\n[u.2:2.3] Matter of perspective.<br/>\n[u.1:2.3] That\u2019s the shadow talking.<br/>\n[u.2:2.4] And am I not.<br/>\n[u.1:2.4] The shadow?<br/>\n[u.2:2.5] Ya know... These past cycles, you\u2019ve made an honorable effort. Tried your best to correct my course. But I don\u2019t know it needs correcting.<br/>\n[u.1:2.5] And if it does?<br/>\n[u.2:2.6] Could be too late.<br/>\n[u.1:2.6] &#39;Could be&#39; is a winding path.<br/>\n[u.2:2.7] Long way from where I was to where I\u2019m going.<br/>\n[u.1:2.7] That is my hope. That there is still time.<br/>\n[u.2:2.8] For?<br/>\n[u.1:2.8] Corrective measures. The righting of our path. The cleansing of your shadow and a return to the Light.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:2.9] Why\u2019d you pick me?<br/>\n[u.1:2.9] It doesn\u2019t work that way.<br/>\n[u.2:3.0] Was I special?<br/>\n[u.1:3.0] You were.<br/>\n[u.2:3.1] But only as special as any other.<br/>\n[u.1:3.1] You are all special.<br/>\n[u.2:3.2] Seems to contradict the word don\u2019t it.<br/>\n[u.1:3.2] Not in my estimation.<br/>\n[u.2:3.3] If we\u2019re all special, are any of us special?<br/>\n[u.1:3.3] Is that what you want? To be special?<br/>\n[u.2:3.4] Heh.<br/>\n[u.1:3.4] You dismiss, but it\u2019s a very serious question. Is that all you\u2019re after? Is all of the death worth that badge?<br/>\n[u.2:3.5] Am I not already more than the rest?<br/>\n[u.1:3.5] Looking at you here, now. The smoke, ash and bone at your feet mark you as so much less.<br/>\n[u.2:3.6] Maybe. And yet here you are.<br/>\n[u.1:3.6] Meaning?<br/>\n[u.2:3.7] You have been at my side every step of the way.<br/>\n[u.1:3.7] Where else would I be?<br/>\n[u.2:3.8] Yet you disagree so thoroughly with my change in perspective.<br/>\n[u.1:3.8] If only the change was simply one of perspective. Your \u201cevolution\u201d was no choice. This is not you having come to an understanding after careful considered thought. This is corruption.<br/>\n[u.2:3.9] The shadows?<br/>\n[u.1:3.9] The Darkness.<br/>\n[u.2:4.0] Maybe so.<br/>\n[u.1:4.0] There is no maybe here.<br/>\n[u.2:4.1] And you think you can save me?<br/>\n[u.1:4.1] I rekindled your Light, it falls first to me to aid in its survival.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:4.2] I tire of it.<br/>\n[u.1:4.2] You must try...<br/>\n[u.2:4.3] I tire of you.<br/>\n[u.1:4.3] [REDACTED]...<br/>\n[u.2:4.4] That is no longer my name.<br/>\n[u.1:4.4] I will not speak the other.<br/>\n[u.2:4.5] It doesn\u2019t matter. This is where we part ways.<br/>\n[u.1:4.5] I will not leave you.<br/>\n[u.2:4.6] I am leaving you.<br/>\n[u.1:4.6] Without me, your journey ahead will be more than any one Guardian can handle.<br/>\n[u.2:4.7] That\u2019s the point. It\u2019s been sometime since you saw me as worthy of walking among those I once called brother and sister. Yet... anymore, I feel as though I am worthy of so much more.<br/>\n[u.1:4.7] Without me... You will die.<br/>\n[u.2:4.8] Someday. Won\u2019t be the first time.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:4.9] Consider this my last good deed. I am releasing you of the burden of my deeds, both done and yet to come.<br/>\n[u.1:4.8] I will not abandon you.<br/>\n[u.2:5.0] You will. Or I will carve the Light from your shell and leave the carcass of my first and last friend in the dirt of this dull, red world for no one to find.<br/>\n[u.1:4.9] Then I\u2019ve failed you, completely.<br/>\n[u.2:5.1] Not me. Maybe the man I was.<br/>\n[u.1:5.0] He is truly dead.<br/>\n[u.2:5.2] I believe so.<br/>\n[u.1:5.1] Belief is not fact.<br/>\n[u.2:5.3] Semantics I no longer have the patience for.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:5.4] When you speak of me, use my proper name. Tell them of the man that stands before you, not the ghost of the hero I once was.<br/>\n[u.1:5.2] You will always be [REDACTED] to me.<br/>\n[u.2:5.5] If you cannot let that man go, you will forever taint his legacy. All the good I have ever done will be washed away in the fire of who I have become.<br/>\n[u.1:5.3] If you care, there is still some promise within you.<br/>\n[u.2:5.6] If I am being honest, I care only to give hope to the frightened, huddled masses so that when I come upon them they will have more to lose. Their pain will be greater. Their screams more pure. <br/>\n[u.1:5.4] You...<br/>\n[u.2:5.7] Nothing dies like hope. I cherish it. <br/>\n[u.1:5.5] You\u2019re a monster.<br/>\n[u.2:5.8] Finally, you see the truth.<br/>\n[u.1:5.6] [REDACTED] is truly dead.<br/>\n[u.2:5.9] So I\u2019ve said. Long live Dredgen Yor.<br/>\n[u.1:5.7] This is farewell, but you can only run from your sins so far. In the end, you will die alone.<br/>\n[u.2:6.0] Maybe so. But I gotta tell ya... I tend to like my odds.<br/>\n[u.1:5.8] Your tainted \u201cRose\u201d will not always save you.<br/>\n[u.2:6.1] Old friend... It already has.",
