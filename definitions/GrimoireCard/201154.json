    "cardDescription": "Ikora: And this Omnigul is here? On Earth?<br/><br/>\nEris: I can feel it.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Why?<br/><br/>\nEris: She\u2019s left the Hellmouth. Her inner chambers are active. More so than I have seen. But she is no longer in the shadows.<br/><br/>\nIkora: No, not\u2014I don&#39;t question your belief. I\u2019m asking why she is here. Why Earth? Please, try to be clear. There is no time for cryptic half-answers and almost-truths.<br/><br/>\nEris: Heh.<br/><br/>\nIkora: She still laughs.<br/><br/>\nEris: It seems I have become more like the Speaker\u2014<br/><br/>\nIkora: Secrets have their places. Here, now, is not that place. Omnigul. Tell me what you\u2019ve learned. Tell me how we stop her.<br/><br/>\nEris: There may be no stopping what comes. The Hive in Old Russia\u2014in that dead land\u2014their assault on the Cosmodrome is no coincidence. They move against the Light with purpose. Always with purpose.<br/><br/>\nIkora: The Warmind?<br/><br/>\nEris: Rasputin. Yes. The last fail safe against the night.<br/><br/>\nIkora: He\u2019s still yet to heed our calls\u2014<br/><br/>\nEris: I\u2019m aware.<br/><br/>\nIkora: \u2014but seems just.<br/><br/>\nEris: Just is enough. Just can save us all.<br/><br/>\nIkora: And the Hive?<br/><br/>\nEris: They will tear into its eyes\u2014or worse.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Worse?<br/><br/>\nEris: The dust and bone and horror of their existence is simply who\u2014what they are. But it does not negate their ageless intelligence.<br/><br/>\nIkora: They do not seek to destroy Rasputin.<br/><br/>\nEris: I don\u2019t know. Destroying Rasputin would cost us a treasure beyond belief. But, such fury twisted to the Hive\u2019s ends?<br/><br/>\nIkora: We would fall.<br/><br/>\nEris: All would fall.<br/><br/>\nIkora: The Omnigul is here for Rasputin.<br/><br/>\nEris: She is here to pave the way.<br/><br/>\nIkora: For Crota?<br/><br/>\nEris: That could just be the beginning. He&#39;s not their only god.<br/><br/>\nIkora: As I am learning. I will make the others listen.<br/><br/>\nEris: It may be too late.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Then you need a new army.<br/><br/>\nEris: I\u2019ve made that mistake before.<br/><br/>\nIkora: You saved us all. Your sacrifice\u2014<br/><br/>\nEris: I am still here. My sacrifice was\u2014<br/><br/>\nIkora: Enough.<br/><br/>\nEris: And I should ask new heroes to fall... as they did?<br/><br/>\nIkora: It is why we were reborn in the Light.<br/><br/>\nEris: My Light is all but gone.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Cherish what remains, but know that you have done enough. Your time in the shadows... I can&#39;t fathom\u2014<br/><br/>\nEris: My role among the Hidden is an honor.<br/><br/>\nIkora: None would argue. But it&#39;s had its cost. Your place is to gather the understanding we need to wage these wars, but your own war is long done. Let those prepared to fight, fight.<br/><br/>\nEris: And should they die?<br/><br/>\nIkora: None who walk these Towers is afraid\u2014and Rasputin must not fall.<br/><br/>\nEris: Then Omnigul must be stopped.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Two goals that appear to be one and the same.<br/><br/>\nEris: Perhaps. So I am to stay?<br/><br/>\nIkora: I will see to it.<br/><br/>\nEris: Then let us hope we are strong enough to stand against what is upon us\u2014and hope the others do not follow.",
