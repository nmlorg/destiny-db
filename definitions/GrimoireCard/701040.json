    "cardDescription": "Look at you!<br/><br/>\nAlready you are grown, my daughter, already you are a wizard. Have I been away so long? Now you are Ir An&#251;k, and Savath&#251;n cackles and rages at your brilliance. You have written eleven axioms describing the ascendant places, our throne world. You have announced that you will kill one of these axioms, as Akka would kill the truth, and in mantling Akka you will become a God, as I am.<br/><br/>\nIf you try it I may kill you, or I may applaud. Well done. I brought you this bitter acid for your celebrations.<br/><br/>\nAnd you, Ir Halak, you are a wizard too, as is the way of twins. I have been with Xivu Arath, who complains that you have made a song, and sung it in her throne world, and killed everyone who listened, quite irrevocably. Will we have songs instead of swords and boomers?<br/><br/>\nWhat have you made for me? It is a tooth shaped like death! I will keep it in my mouth. What have you written for me? It is the course of the Nicha Thought-ship! I will track it down.<br/><br/>\nI made you by cutting one larvae in half. It would not die. Each half grew into one of you. My sword is named Willbreaker, but it never broke you.",
