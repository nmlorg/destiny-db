    "cardDescription": "I\u2019m walking down the road, I\u2019m going to the orrery to talk to my dad, and I hear, well, I hear this noise, so I look back. And my sisters are behind me, and they\u2019re ripping up the road. They\u2019ve got these huge swords, execution swords, and they\u2019re levering the stones out of the road. The stones are covered in writing. They\u2019re like tablets. And there\u2019s dirt underneath full of worms.<br/><br/>\nI need to get to the orrery before they catch up to me so I start running but right away someone trips me, it\u2019s my dad, he\u2019s got his foot out and he grabs me by the horns and just slams me down on my face. I\u2019m in so much pain I nearly throw up a worm.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you ready for this,\u201d dad says. He\u2019s wearing glare goggles, those shiny goggles that he\u2019d use to save his vision during lightning storms or sea fire. All three of his eyes reflect me. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know they\u2019d be jealous, because they couldn\u2019t come to the orrery and talk to me? Didn\u2019t you know they\u2019d move against you??\u201d<br/><br/>\nI start wailing like I\u2019m two days old again and I say, Dad, I thought you were my friend, I\u2019m supposed to be safe here. But he just puts out his fist and I realize he\u2019s laughing at me for believing him, why did I think I\u2019d be safe? In his fist he\u2019s got a black sun and he holds me by the throat and goes to tip the black sun inside me.<br/><br/>\nI can see my jaws in his goggles, three reflections of my jaws with so many teeth.<br/><br/>\nSo I start eating my dad. I bite huge pieces out of him and I claw him up. I eat his legs and I eat his arms and I eat his goggles and his eyes and he says, good, good, this is majestic and true.<br/><br/>\nBut my sisters are still tearing up the road so I don\u2019t know how to get back.",
