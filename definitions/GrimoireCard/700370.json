    "cardDescription": "He could feel his light draining. He pulled all of it into one last hope.<br/><br/>\nHe reeled back and <i>bam!</i><br/><br/>\nHis helm found purchase, breaking through just above the Kell\u2019s eyes. The Ether screamed from his head and together they fell to the ground.<br/><br/>\nThe Exo Guardian rose, staggering back. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the Kell\u2019s body. He\u2019d never seen any Fallen withstand a skull puncture, but this was no ordinary Fallen. He waited...and waited.<br/><br/>\n\u201cGhost?\u201d The words barely audible. He heard her flash in, but had a hard time pinning her down. She was buzzing about, surveying the Fallen Kell.<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead alright. So that\u2019s it, we are done now?\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe removed his helm, tossed it aside, and dropped to his knees.<br/><br/>\nThe Devils without a Kell. This war was over, at last. They could finally go home.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe are. Get me the Speaker.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cOpening his channel. Stand by.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIs that you, my son?\u201d The Speaker\u2019s voice was filled more with anticipation of news than concern.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt is, father. The Devil Kell Solkis... is dead. This war is over.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cSuch courage and power\u2014the greatest ever to brace these worlds. You bring all of us peace, we will light the final flare, Devil Red. They will all know what you&#39;ve done.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cFather, I don\u2019t think I have the energy to return. I\u2019ll rest here, and come back to be honored when I return.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cOf course, son, but\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThere is something concerning you? More Fallen march on the City?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo, not this time. I have word that Osiris was seen on Mercury. The Caloris Basin. He\u2019s turned his mind back to the Vex.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cMercury? Too many channels to know. You activate one, you start to feed its veins. He threatens our peace.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYour duty, my son. You must never forget.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI cannot.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Ghost killed the feed and waited for its Guardian\u2019s words.<br/>\n\u201cGhost, prepare my Vex arsenal and plot a course for Mercury. That old man is about to wake up hell.\u201d",
