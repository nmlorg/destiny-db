    "cardDescription": "<i>Then.</i><br/><br/>\nPalamon was ash.<br/><br/>\nI was only a boy \u2013 my face caked in soot, snot and sorrow.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019d assumed Jaren, my friend, our Guardian, the savior of Palamon, would always protect us \u2013 could always save us...<br/><br/>\nBut I was a fool.<br/><br/>\nJaren, and the others, only a handful, but still our best hunters, our hardest hearts, had left three suns prior. Tracking Fallen, after the bandits had caused a stir.<br/><br/>\nThe stranger \u2013 the other \u2013 arrived the following day.<br/><br/>\nHe rarely spoke. Took a room. Took our hospitality.<br/><br/>\nI was intrigued by him, as I was Jaren when he\u2019d first arrived.<br/><br/>\nBut the stranger was cold. Distant. Damaged, I thought.<br/><br/>\nBut I wasn\u2019t afraid. Not yet.<br/><br/>\nOnly a child, I knew the monsters of our world to walk like men, but they were not. They were something alien. Four-armed and savage.<br/><br/>\nThe stranger was polite, but solemn.<br/><br/>\nI took him for a sad, broken man, and he was. Though, at the time, I didn\u2019t understand how that could make one dangerous.<br/><br/>\nAs with Jaren, father made an effort to keep me away from the stranger.<br/><br/>\nIt wouldn\u2019t matter.<br/><br/>\nAs the silhouette approached, fear held tight.<br/><br/>\nThe dark figure towered over me. Looking into me \u2013 through me.<br/><br/>\nHe smiled. My knees weak. All lost.<br/><br/>\nThen, he turned and walked away.<br/><br/>\nLeaving ruin and a heartbroken, terrified boy in his wake without a second glance.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019ve been chasing that stranger\u2019s shadow ever since.<br/><br/><br/><i>Now.</i><br/><br/>\nWe stood silent, the sun high.<br/><br/>\nSeconds passed, feeling more like hours.<br/><br/>\nHe looked different.<br/><br/>\nHe seemed, now, to be weightless \u2013 effortless in an existence that would crush a man burdened by conscience.<br/><br/>\nMy gaze remained locked as I felt a heat rising inside of me.<br/>\nThe other spoke...<br/><br/>\n\u201cBeen awhile.\u201d<br/><br/>\nI gave no reply.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe gunslinger\u2019s sword... his cannon. That was a gift.\u201d<br/><br/>\nMy silence held as my thumb caressed the perfectly worn hammer at my hip.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAn offering from me... to you.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe heat grew. Centered in my chest.<br/><br/>\nI felt like a coward the day Jaren Ward died and for many cycles after.<br/><br/>\nBut here, I felt only the fire of my Light.<br/><br/>\nThe other probed...<br/><br/>\n\u201cNothing to say?\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe let the words hang.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you. For this day.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHis attempt at conversation felt mundane when judged against all that had come before.<br/><br/>\n\u201cMany times I thought you\u2019d faltered. Given up...\u201d<br/><br/>\nAll I\u2019d lost, all who\u2019d suffered, flashed rapid through my mind, intercut with a dark silhouette walking toward a frightened, weak, coward of a boy.<br/><br/>\nThe fire burned in me.<br/><br/>\nThe other continued...<br/><br/>\n\u201cBut here you are. This is truly an end...\u201d<br/><br/>\nAs his tongue slipped between syllables my gun hand moved as if of its own will.<br/><br/>\nReflex and purpose merged with anger, clarity and an overwhelming need for just that... an end.<br/><br/>\nIn step with my motion, the fire within burst into focus \u2013 through my shoulder, down my arm \u2013 as my finger closed on the trigger of my third father\u2019s cannon.<br/><br/>\nTwo shots. Two bullets engulfed in an angry glow. <br/>\nThe other fell.<br/><br/>\nI walked to his corpse. He never raised his cursed Thorn \u2013 the jagged gun with the festering sickness.<br/><br/>\nI looked down at the dead man who had caused so much death.<br/><br/>\nMy shooter still embraced by the dancing flames of my Light.<br/>\nA sadness came over me.<br/><br/>\nI thought back to my earliest days. Of Palamon. Of Jaren.<br/><br/>\nLeveling my cannon at the dead man\u2019s helm, I paid one final tribute to my mentor, my savior, my father and my friend...<br/><br/>\n\u201cYours... Not mine.\u201d<br/><br/>\n...as I closed my grip, allowing Jaren\u2019s cannon, now my own, to have the last, loud word.",
