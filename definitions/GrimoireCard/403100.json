    "cardDescription": "&quot;And so it is agreed. The Concordat shall no longer be recognized among the Consensus. We&#39;ll begin the dismantling right away. But what of those Guardians who have pledged to them? We can&#39;t afford any more banishments.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m sure Zavala can see to their realignment.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ll do our best. Lysander chose his followers wisely. It may take some time.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Lysander will not back down. He&#39;ll continue his crusade from wherever we stuff him.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;And so we&#39;ll need to find some new ideas to replace his.&quot; <br/><br/>\n&quot;The Symmetry has been gaining a strong following...&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Ulan-Tan&#39;s teachings are too dangerous. Too much fear. Who knew he&#39;d be more trouble dead than alive?&quot; <br/><br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ll need to refocus our collective minds on combat. The Speaker&#39;s anxious to regain ground we lost after the Gap.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;There is the War Cult.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Too secretive. Have you ever tried to talk to one of their &#39;soldiers&#39;? Like a child. Answering questions with questions.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;They are dedicated to the war.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Which one?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Good question.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Zavala?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;They seem focused. Strong. More interesting than worrisome.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s take it to a vote. All in favor of the ascension of the Future War Cult?&quot; <br/><br/>\n&quot;Unanimous? Good. We&#39;ll grant the Future War Cult access to the Tower and a seat among us. Ghost, please offer the Speaker this proposal.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Now onto the next order of business...Shaxx is here with another proposal for his Crucible.&quot;",
