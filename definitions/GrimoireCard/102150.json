    "cardDescription": "Hi. Thanks for your interest. I&#39;m recording this for posterity.<br/><br/>\nWarlock thanatonauts die and come back with insight. I&#39;m going to attempt the same process to get at buried memories. Specifically, I&#39;m going to fire a charged particle beam into my head and see what comes out. We Exos have been around a very long time. I want to know what&#39;s in there.<br/><br/>\nMy Ghost is standing by to repair me.<br/><br/>\nOkay. Three two one<br/><br/>\nSTAG echo six SWORD sierra nine SERPENT<br/><br/>\nWe are falling into the world. Everyone is on fire. There&#39;s a ship above us but it&#39;s coming apart just like a flower, alloy and fusion flash, pierced through and through - <br/><br/>\nThe voice says Atmospheric interface. Trajectory nominal. Rabid two three you are outside the window. (I think I am the voice)<br/><br/>\nI can see the whole earth below me and the sky we are falling out of is black without stars.<br/><br/>\nGhost, shoot me again.<br/><br/>\nRAPID four RAMPART four RATCHET tango eight zero<br/><br/>\nWe are on the ice. This is elsewhere and elsewhen. There is a mighty aurora and it is reflected in the ice so I walk between two fires although the one below is cracked and full of corpses. I have and am a weapon.<br/><br/>\nUp in the sky there is a hole in Jupiter and it tears at me when I look at it. It tears at me. It is hungry. Maybe the hole is not in Jupiter but in me.<br/><br/>\nCROWN castle candor cobalt coral<br/><br/>\nGhost bring me back.<br/><br/>\nserrate sulfur ANATHEMA amber actual aspen<br/><br/>\nGhost bring me back now.",
