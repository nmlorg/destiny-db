    "cardDescription": "Three human beings stood on a high ridge and saw the shape of the future. Saw rain strike a millennia-old desert. Felt the air sweeten with oxygen and warm water and the beginnings of life.<br/><br/>\nI am sometimes asked if I felt something die. The end of the era of human self-sufficiency.<br/><br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to answer that question. I do know that I was changed. Nobody could experience that kind of wonder and remain unchanged. The decades since have proven that to me.<br/><br/>\nI knew I&#39;d never fly another mission like that. I recognized the need for a new love. That&#39;s why I threw my fresh cognitive skills into understanding the Traveler. How can one entity so quickly and utterly remake an entire world? Fifty years later, I&#39;m conversant in high mathematics, particularly topological thoughts and the slippery irreality of Light. I&#39;m involved in a project to study the Traveler&#39;s terraforming actions right now.<br/><br/>\nBut I still enjoy the interviews. I like going back to that mission.<br/><br/>\nIt makes me unspeakably happy to see how well it all turned out. And it makes me happy to remember I was there.",
