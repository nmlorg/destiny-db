    "cardDescription": "In the tales of the Iron Lords, Lady Efrideet was one of the most prominent characters. She once threw Saladin like a javelin into a Fallen Walker\u2014a City favorite retold for centuries. How she met her end is less clear, but the tales agreed that Efrideet had long ago died her final death.<br/><br/>\nUntil she returned. <br/><br/>\nNow Efrideet serves as the new Iron Banner representative while Lord Saladin devotes his attention to the SIVA Crisis. She urges Guardians to see the Banner tournament as a chance to strengthen their Light, for fighting and for more metaphysical purposes. The Vanguard are also intrigued by Efrideet\u2019s accounts of a nonmilitary Guardian community in the deep system, but Efrideet, though happy to talk about the group\u2019s pacifist philosophies, refuses to disclose the settlement\u2019s location at present.",
