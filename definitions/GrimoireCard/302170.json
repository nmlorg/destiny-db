Jagged, like thorns.<br/>\n[u.2:4.5] I used to think of it as a rose...<br/>\n[u.2:4.6] Focusing on its bloom.<br/>\n[u.2:4.7] But the bloom is just a byproduct of its anger.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:4.8] You have nightmares?<br/>\n[audible sobbing]<br/>\n[u.2:4.9] Ever seen a nightmare? Ever opened your eyes and realized the horror wasn&#39;t a dream? The terror wasn&#39;t gone?<br/>\n[u.2:5.0] I&#39;ve seen nightmares.<br/>\n[u.2:5.1] They live in the shadows.<br/>\n[u.2:5.2] They&#39;ve been watching.<br/>\n[u.2:5.3] I thought...It&#39;s foolish, I know...but I thought I saw a way.<br/>\n[u.2:5.4] That maybe we could win. Maybe we could survive.<br/>\n[u.2:5.5] But once you step into those shadows, it&#39;s so very hard to walk in the Light.<br/>\n[u.2:5.6] Or...maybe I just wasn&#39;t strong enough.<br/>\n[u.2:5.7] Maybe.<br/>\n[u.2:5.8] But I feel strong now.<br/>\n[audible sobbing]<br/>\n[u.2:5.9] I stole the dark.<br/>\n[u.2:6.0] Or, maybe it stole me.<br/>\n[u.2:6.1] Either way, here we are.<br/>\n[u.2:6.2] And I&#39;m hungry.<br/>\n[u.2:6.3] Its hungry.<br/>\n[u.2:6.4] You have no Light beyond the spark of your pathetic life.<br/>\n[u.2:6.5] But a spark is something.<br/>\n[audible sobbing]<br/>\n[u.2:6.6] Open your eyes.<br/>\n[audible sobbing]<br/>\n[audible sobbing]<br/>\n[audible crack]<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[silence]<br/><br/>\n/...END TRANSCRIPT///",
