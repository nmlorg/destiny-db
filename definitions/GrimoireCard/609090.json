    "cardDescription": "ARENA DESIGNATION: Firebase Delphi<br/>\nLOCATION: Eos Chasma, Mars<br/><br/>\nWhen the Cabal decide to hold an area, they dig in deep. It&#39;s surprising, then, that the tunnel system at Firebase Delphi is woefully incomplete by Sand Eater standards. One theory is that it was built simply to be inspected, to satisfy some commander&#39;s lack of progress on another front. Perhaps the Cabal simply cut their losses once they realized that the location of the base was sub-optimal, although half-measures are really not something they&#39;re known for. We&#39;re talking about a culture that will grind a mountain to dust rather than build around it.",
