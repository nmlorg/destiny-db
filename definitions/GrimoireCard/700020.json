    "cardDescription": "Fear.  That\u2019s the only vivid memory left in me.  It\u2019s the moment when my fear was so thick and urgent that I gave up breathing.  I stopped pretending to think.  How I remained on my feet was a mystery, because the terror was bearing down on me, like a mountain about to crush my soul.<br/><br/>\nBut I have to ask, \u201cWhat was terrifying me?\u201d<br/><br/>\nDarkness ruled the sky.  The world around us had shattered, and it seemed vanishingly unlikely that we would outlive this one awful day.  Yet the fear didn\u2019t come from the surrounding mayhem and despair.  The source was inside my skin.  I was utterly terrified of my own awful nature.<br/><br/>\nAnd which part scared me?<br/><br/>\nInside me was an essence woven from beyond.  Was I Awoken before this?<br/><br/>\nShe was still in my head. I could hear her song growing fainter.<br/><br/>\nGone?<br/><br/>\nNot yet.<br/><br/>\nA new crippling terror was taking over.<br/><br/>\nI was focused entirely on my fear.  But I had to make an effort.<br/><br/>\nAnd it occurred to me then that nothing in the universe was more dangerous than human hubris.<br/><br/>\nI still had this Other within? But the human side was what mattered:  Weak and foolhardy, sure to fail in the next moment.<br/><br/>\nThat\u2019s why I was afraid.<br/><br/>\nThen someone spoke.<br/><br/>\nMaybe it was me.  I don\u2019t remember.<br/><br/>\nI was trying to focus, and a new thought took me: My soul lay between those two entities.  And that\u2019s how I am still:  The boundary, the seam.<br/><br/>\nThe friction.<br/><br/>\nAnd that\u2019s when the fear began to fade.",
