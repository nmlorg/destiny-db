    "cardDescription": "Prince Uldren: Look at it from the House of Kings&#39; perspective. Their power is matched only by their cleverness. They rule the Devils from the shadows and came too close to toppling the City not once, but twice.  We don&#39;t know much about them, but we know this: the Kings want the Traveler.<br/><br/>\nSo why would they give it all up just because some outsystem Wolf runs in calling himself Kell of Kells?<br/><br/>\nThe answer is: they wouldn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nPetra Venj: But what if Skolas could somehow prove to them that he&#39;s the prophesied leader? Some artifact, or trick?<br/><br/>\nYasmin Eld: Perhaps a new power, even.<br/><br/>\nPrince Uldren: No. Short of the Traveler itself calling Skolas by name, the Kings would not just roll over for anyone, no matter what. They&#39;re too ambitious.<br/><br/>\nPetra Venj: You sound like you admire them.<br/><br/>\nPrince Uldren: Power cleverly deployed is always worth admiring.<br/><br/>\nYasmin Eld: So why send the King Barons?",
