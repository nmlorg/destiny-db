    "cardDescription": "Something in Rezyl was telling him he shouldn&#39;t be here.<br/><br/>\nSomething deep.<br/><br/>\nSomething resembling fear.<br/><br/>\nHe knelt, examining the dust-covered pile at his feet.<br/><br/>\nThe skulls had been discarded with little care some time ago \u2013 decades, maybe longer.<br/><br/>\nThe doors carved into the rock face were arcane \u2013 dark, gothic... other... and large.<br/><br/>\nThe jagged finery of their archway spoke to an artistry that only served to strengthen the sinking feeling in his gut.<br/><br/>\nRezyl had come to Luna in search of nightmares, and after his long journey\u2014from the growing City beneath the Traveler to the ends of the Earth and beyond\u2014he found himself face-to-face with the remnants of stories he&#39;d hoped were nothing but lies.<br/><br/>\nHe stood, a large man made small against the massive, looming doorway.<br/><br/>\nThe knot in his stomach was telling him to turn back.<br/><br/>\nInstead, he moved forward, toward the doors; sealed, as they were, for ages untold.<br/><br/>\nAfter only a few steps, a shrill, heavy scraping cut the air.<br/><br/>\nThe massive doors were opening.<br/><br/>\nRezyl steadied his rifle as a lone shape, floating just above the ground, appeared from the deep black beyond the threshold.<br/><br/>\nThe figure in the doorway\u2014a dark, ethereal woman cloaked in tattered ceremony and armored with ornate bone\u2014danced in the air.<br/><br/>\nRezyl and the demon woman held their ground, contemplating one another.<br/><br/>\nWith no warning the silent intimacy of the moment was broken by a booming, angry call from deep within the doorway. The sound, thick and pained, echoed across the narrow valley then fell silent.<br/><br/>\nAfter a beat that felt like eternity, the figure backed away into the dark.<br/><br/>\nThe doors remained wide \u2013 an invitation or a dare, Rezyl did not know. Nor did he care.<br/><br/>\nThe mighty Titan took steps forward.<br/><br/>\n\u201cUhhhh... I\u2019m not sure this is a good idea,\u201d his Ghost\u2019s concern was impossible to mistake.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNot sure that matters.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come. We\u2019ve seen. Maybe the best course here is to warn others. Gather an army.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying... It\u2019s possible you can\u2019t handle whatever it is we\u2019ve upset here.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019ve woken nightmares.\u201d Rezyl\u2019s attention was singular; focused intently on the dark beyond the threshold.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe Hive were supposed to be gone.\u201d The Ghost mulled the full consequence of this mistaken belief. \u201cThey\u2019ve been silent for\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThey\u2019re not silent anymore.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat scream? These doors? They\u2019re best left alone.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl continued forward. Toward the dark. Toward the unknown.<br/><br/>\n\u201cStay here.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cGet distance. We don\u2019t know what this is... what\u2019s coming. Can\u2019t risk you too close to an unknown.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAnd if you fall where I can\u2019t find you?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIf I fall... If I don\u2019t return. Run. Tell the others. Warn them all... There are worse things than pirates.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl steadied his rifle and stepped into the dark, as his Ghost lingered.<br/><br/>\n&#8212;-<br/><br/>\nHours passed. More? Time was lost in this place, and with it any remembrance of hope... of promise... of purpose in the longing for a brighter tomorrow. <br/><br/>\nDown amongst the shadows there were no tomorrows.<br/><br/>\nDown in the abyss there was no hope.<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s footfalls echoed; lonely, measured steps with no guarantee of purchase. At any moment the world could fall away and he would be lost \u2013 the forgotten hero who foolishly sought nightmares.<br/><br/>\nThen, a presence. Sweeping and dream-like.<br/><br/>\nRezyl leveled his rifle.<br/><br/>\nHe could sense the witch, but found it impossible to track her in the dark.<br/><br/>\nRezyl opened fire. Short, focused bursts to light the ebony corridor.<br/><br/>\nThe demon witch circled just beyond the reach of each burst\u2019s glow.<br/><br/>\nRezyl kept firing, using the short flickers of light to gain bearing. <br/><br/>\nThe witch laughed and a thick black cloud engulfed Rezyl. <br/><br/>\nThe Titan kept firing but his movements were restricted. The cloud confined him, caged him.<br/><br/>\nHe could hear her moving just beyond his sight as her laughter rose in pitch, cutting into Rezyl\u2019s mind and soul like a tempered blade.<br/><br/>\nRezyl flinched as the wicked woman began to speak in a tongue that resembled torture more than language.<br/><br/>\nThe pain was searing, complete.<br/><br/>\nThe demon approached the writhing hero.<br/><br/>\nAs she spoke her violent words began to take shape, morphing from syllables of death to a known offering of haunted human languages.<br/><br/>\nThe demon woman leaned in close... and whispered, intimately. <br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s ears bled as she spoke.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I am the end of &#39;morrows. Xyor, the Blessed. Xyor, the Betrothed. I am of the coming storm. These are not my words, but prophesy. Your Light will one day shatter and die. For now it simply offends... And you, dear, sweet, fragile thing, shall be made to suffer for your transgressions upon this holy ground.&quot;<br/><br/>\nAs the witch fell silent, her hateful voice was replaced by a growing chorus of hungry, manic chittering and the rising thunder of an approaching flood.<br/><br/>\nRezyl had come looking for the terrors that hide just beyond the light.<br/><br/>\nHe found them.<br/><br/>\nOr, maybe...<br/><br/>\n...they found him.",
