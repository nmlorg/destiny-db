    "cardDescription": "When did the City Age begin? Perhaps when the bulk of the world&#39;s survivors lived beneath the Traveler, rather than in the wilderness. Or when the Titans raised the first wall. Or at Six Fronts, when the City first faced coordinated, overwhelming attack - and repelled it decisively.<br/><br/>\nThe City did not rise without struggle. Warlords and wilderness fiefdoms clung to power. Starvation, disease, and anarchy menaced. But the Guardians held the frontier, and the children of the Golden Age kept the fire burning through the long climb back.<br/><br/>\nLegends walk through this history. The Iron Lords. Saint-14&#39;s crusade against the Fallen. The mask of the Speaker. The great Ahamkara Hunt. Toland&#39;s madness. Terrible Faction Wars - and the horrifying, disastrous effort to retake the Moon. <br/><br/>\nAs the City learned to walk again, it found a world overrun by alien menace. It faced disaster and defeat. Even in recent years, as Guardians begin to venture back to the Moon and the inner planets, the City&#39;s territory has withdrawn - outer sections abandoned and converted into fortifications in the wake of the Battle of Twilight Gap.<br/><br/>\nBut the City&#39;s shipwrights and foundries hum with energy. The probability kilns and work cooperatives produce new wonders. The Darkness is rising again. But so is the Light.",
