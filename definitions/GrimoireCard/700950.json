    "cardDescription": "This is the Coronation of Oryx, the Taken King. It happened thus.<br/><br/>\nIn the cold abyss of the sword world, King Aurash walked under a cloak of green fire. He walked through the sky and the sky shuddered and froze beneath his feet. He walked until he found Akka, the Worm of Secrets, who was denying a truth until it became a lie.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAkka my God, Worm of Secrets. I am Auryx, sole king of the Hive. I have come to receive a secret. I want the secret power of the Deep, which you hold.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI give no secrets,\u201d said Akka, whose voice was code.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Auryx, \u201cyou give nothing. Giving is for the Sky. You worship the Deep, which asks that we take what we need.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAkka said nothing, because if it denied this truth, the truth might become false.<br/><br/>\n \u201cBut you gave us your larvae, the worm,\u201d said Auryx, \u201cand that is why the worm devours us now: because it was given, not taken. So I must take what I need from you, although you are my god.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSaid Akka, \u201cYou have not the strength.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut this was a lie. Auryx had killed Savath&#251;n his sibling and Xivu Arath his sibling, and he had the sword logic of killing them.<br/><br/>\nAuryx the First Navigator set upon his god with his sword and his words, and cut Akka to pieces, and took from those pieces the secret of calling upon the Deep. He wrote this secret on a set of tablets, which he called the Tablets of Ruin. And he wore them about his waist.<br/><br/>\nThen Auryx said, \u201cNow I may speak to the Deep, the beautiful final shape. I will be King of Shapes. I will learn all the secrets of our destiny.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHis speech to the Deep is not recorded here. But it is known that he returned, and he said, now I am Oryx, the Taken King. And I have the power to take life and make it my own.<br/><br/>\nThen he went out into the universe, and fought the Ecumene with his Tablets. And the Worm his God was pleased.",
