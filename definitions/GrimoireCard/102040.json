    "cardDescription": "The mission is a go. Crew of three: Mihaylova, Qiao, myself. Immediate departure at the next Hohmann window to Mars. The MREs and return ships will chase us out.<br/><br/>\nHow do I feel? I said at the press conference I felt privileged. Historians will read this diary, but it won&#39;t take their insight to tell the world that I&#39;m terrified. It&#39;s the human reaction.<br/><br/>\nWhat I wish I could convey is the - the exhilaration. That&#39;s the biggest thing. I&#39;m not a spiritual man, but I&#39;ve always believed there&#39;s something transcendent about spaceflight. Something pure. We go out there because we can. Because it&#39;s who we are.<br/><br/>\nNow we go because we have to. Because the unknown came to us. In fourteen months we&#39;ll be face to face with it, and by the time we arrive, it should be active again - just like it was active on Jupiter, and Mercury, and Venus.<br/><br/>\nI wonder what happens if it doesn&#39;t stop at Mars. I wonder if it&#39;ll leave us there in the sand, and come to Earth, and do here what it&#39;s done everywhere else.<br/><br/>\nI hate that we&#39;re carrying weapons. I understand the necessity. But I hold to my belief: there&#39;s something beautiful out there.<br/><br/>\nIt&#39;s up to us to reach it.",
