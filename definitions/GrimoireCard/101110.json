    "cardDescription": "My name is Eriana-3, disciple of the Praxic Warlocks, marked by the Cormorant Seal. We came here under one banner, united in a host of thousands, to claim the Moon. But the battle goes against us. I have taken a prisoner and this is the record of its interrogation. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your forgiveness.<br/><br/>\n[sound of current or discharge]<br/><br/>\n/Eriana. It responds to pain.<br/><br/>\nIt responds to the Light. Hurt it again. Monster, heed me. Who is your master with the sword?<br/><br/>\n[static event]<br/><br/>\nI can hear it. In my head. The swordbearer&#39;s name is CROTA. Record that.<br/><br/>\n/Should I burn it again?<br/><br/>\nNo. I think you&#39;re only feeding it. I will touch its mind. Ghost - help.<br/><br/>\nThey call you Wizard. You must be ancient. I think you value power very much. Will you still be powerful without this piece of your mind?<br/><br/>\nTell me how to kill Crota.<br/><br/>\n[static event]<br/><br/>\nIt showed me the battle. It showed me Wei Ning dead on Crota&#39;s blade. It showed me how Crota killed a Guardian with a screaming knife hammered out of his own Ghost.<br/><br/>\nSo I will take a piece of its mind, and ask again.<br/><br/>\nTell me how to kill Crota.<br/><br/>\n[static event]<br/><br/>\nIncredible. Where? Where is his throne? Where is the twilight world under the dead star eye?<br/><br/>\n/Eriana there&#39;s word from the company in Mare Imbrium. Crota is upon them. Half a hundred dead. They need us.<br/><br/>\nTell me where! Tell me how! TELL ME!<br/><br/>\n[static event]<br/><br/>\n/Eriana what did it say - <br/><br/>\nIt showed me how it did this, just exactly this, to an Awoken man, the knives arranged by its will, like little silver ships, like Ghosts - <br/><br/>\nIt laughed at me. It said we were the same.<br/><br/>\n/Crota marches with a thousand Knights and they say the sky above Mare Imbrium has turned into green fire. They are dying in numbers I cannot bear to repeat. He kills them one by one with a sword that eats their Light. Eriana, we have to do something - <br/><br/>\nKill the Wizard. Scatter the ash. It has nothing but lies to offer.<br/><br/>\nGet your Sparrows. We have Light and fury. That will be enough.",
