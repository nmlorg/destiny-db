    "cardDescription": "To make his ship, Oryx scrimshawed one piece of Akka, who was dead but far from gone. He stole the Hammer of Xivu Arath and the Scalpel of Savath&#251;n and he armored his ship in baneful armor.<br/><br/>\nWhen Oryx had built his Dreadnaught, he pushed his throne world inside out, so that it bled into the material space of the Dreadnaught. They were coterminous and allied, his ship and his sin. The Dreadnaught was within the throne of Oryx, but the throne of Oryx was the Dreadnaught. Aiat!<br/><br/>\nThis required a verse from the Tablets of Ruin. The whole Court worked together to push Oryx\u2019s throne inside out. This was a day of joyous violence, and all of Oryx\u2019s broods mark this holiday as Eversion Day, which is celebrated by turning things inside out.<br/><br/>\nSayeth Oryx,<br/><br/>\nGo out into the universe, my court<br/>\nGather tribute for me. Send it home to my ship.<br/>\nWhen I call you, walk up that tribute to my court.<br/>\nI will prepare for long voyages \u2014 [I am Savath&#251;n, insidious]<br/>\nInto the war \u2014 [I graffiti this notice for you]<br/>\nInto the Deep \u2014 [These Books are full of lies!]<br/><br/>\nNow Oryx\u2019s throne was safe from incursion, because it moved so nimbly.<br/><br/>\nOryx attacked the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible, who guarded the Nicha Thought-ship. When the Flotilla surrounded his Dreadnaught, Oryx put his sword into the hull, and he used the power of the Deep (and the clever systems his daughters built) to push his throne-world out into mere reality.<br/><br/>\nBy wrath and confidence he filled space with an egg of his throne. It swelled up like a ghost star to smash the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible. Oryx broke the last word off their name.<br/><br/>\nIn the Nicha Thought-ship, Oryx hoped to find the location of the Gift Mast, which had been left behind by the Traveler. Oryx wanted to eat it.<br/><br/>\nBut the Thought-ship was a trap. Upon it was Quria, Blade Transform.",
