    "cardDescription": "Beneath a green fire sky, in the throne-world of King Auryx, our lords embrace.<br/><br/>\nWe the Hive watch as Savath&#251;n puts her arm around Xivu Arath, and Xivu Arath clasps forearms with Auryx, and Auryx takes Savath&#251;n by the shoulder. They are huge, huge, and they burn with furious power. But this embrace is weakness and we despise it.<br/><br/>\nNever before have we despised our lords. Have they failed us? We the Hive have been driven back, world by world.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI am at my end,\u201d Savath&#251;n says. \u201cI plot and plan. But I cannot gather enough bloodshed to feed my worm. And the harder I try, the hungrier it becomes.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI slaughter and kill,\u201d Xivu Arath says, \u201cbut the harder I fight, the more my worm demands. I too am at my end.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe Ecumene war angels have killed me so many times,\u201d Auryx says, \u201cthat I dare not go out into the universe, lest I need my might to protect myself. My worm chews at my soul in hunger.\u201d<br/><br/>\nIs this the end of our crusade? Are we the Hive unworthy to exist?<br/><br/>\nXivu Arath puts down her great head. \u201cWe should retire and gather our strength.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n closes her eyes in puzzled defeat. \u201cWe should beg the Worm our God to tell us what to do.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut King Auryx, who knows best the beauty of the final shape, roars at them. \u201cHave you learned nothing? Would you deny our purpose? Whatever we do, we will do by killing, by an act of war and might. That is the final arbiter we serve, that violent arbiter, and if we turn away from it we deserve to be eaten. No! We must obey our natures. We must be long-sighted, and cunning, and strong. We must take this gift the Worm our God has given us, this challenge, and find a way to keep existing!\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHow will we feed our worms?\u201d Xivu Arath asks.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI know,\u201d says cunning Savath&#251;n. \u201cI know a way. But it won\u2019t work unless we are killing the Ecumene by the billions.  How can we beat them?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIf we cannot beat their strengths,\u201d says Xivu Arath, \u201cwe must infect their weaknesses. But they are lords of matter and physical law.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI know a way,\u201d King Auryx says. \u201cBut it will require great power. More power than any one of us can claim.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThen kill me,\u201d says Xivu Arath, \u201cand use that killing logic, the power you prove by killing something as mighty as me.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSo King Auryx took up his blade and beheaded Xivu Arath.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAnd strangle me,\u201d says Savath&#251;n, holding a blade behind her back. \u201cUse that killing logic, the cunning you prove by killing something as smart as me.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut King Auryx turned with the speed and might of Xivu Arath, and beheaded Savath&#251;n before she could move. King Auryx was the First Navigator, with the map of death.<br/><br/>\nThese were true deaths, for they happened in the sword world.<br/><br/>\nThen he went to the Worm named Akka.",
