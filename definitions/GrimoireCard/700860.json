    "cardDescription": "It\u2019s done. Eir and Yul feed on the Leviathan\u2019s carcass. Xivu Arath has made a temple of the Chroma-Admiral\u2019s impaled corpse. Below us, Savath&#251;n\u2019s poisons stain the Ammonite home sea black. Their screams flavor the void.<br/><br/>\nThe Traveler has fled.<br/><br/>\nDo you understand, Auryx? Do you thrill at the secret, Savath&#251;n? Do you relish the edge of this truth, Xivu Arath?  Do you see the beautiful shape?<br/><br/>\nThe Ammonite occupied a piece of reality. They rented their existence on fraudulent terms, making themselves happy and fat, fencing themselves in soft lies and sweet apocrypha. Saying: \u2018we are peaceful and good, we harm nothing.\u2019<br/><br/>\nTheir golden age was a cancer.<br/><br/>\nThey did nothing to advance the cause of life! They burnt up time and matter and thought on this solipsistic, onanistic pursuit of safety, insulating themselves from death, making a regressive pocket of useless stability. When they could have helped whittle the universe towards its final, perfect form!<br/><br/>\nAnd your people, suffering in the Deep, you became more worthy of existence than the Ammonite. You have proven it.<br/><br/>\nLook around the sky. Behold the great divide, the battle lines of the cosmic war. We are the Worm your God, but we are not the Deep Itself. We only move within it. You shall too. You shall venerate and study it and haunt it in its passage.<br/><br/>\nWill you lift your thoughts to the millennia, Auryx? Will you bend your will to the liberation of the universe, and join us in the war against the Sky?<br/><br/>\nWe need champions. Crusaders. Help us save the universe. Help us exterminate that which would destroy all hope. You are oathbound to this task, by the covenant of the worm.<br/><br/>\nAnd you are oathbound to kill Taox. Wherever she\u2019s hidden herself.",
