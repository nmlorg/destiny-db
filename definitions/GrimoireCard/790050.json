His power lingers unclaimed.<br/><br/>\nA king is dead. His pride in a lineage meant to stretch across time and stars serving as his undoing.<br/><br/>\nBut Noru\u2019usk has no lineage to consider. <br/><br/>\nNoru\u2019usk has no flaw.<br/><br/>\nHe is a soldier. A general. A maker of war.<br/><br/>\nOnce a servant, his eyes turn toward the vacant throne, there for the taking on the other side of this temporary cage.<br/><br/>\nA king is dead. Good riddance.<br/><br/>\nA king will rise.<br/><br/>\nIf not Noru\u2019usk, another.<br/><br/>\nIf not another...",
