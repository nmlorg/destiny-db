    "cardDescription": "Nothing born is born strong.<br/><br/>\nI know I began weak, the same as you. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re an Exo, staring at that number and wondering where you&#39;ve come from. Or a Human hungry to understand the ancient world that left you for dead. Or an Awoken reborn in the very essence of what your people hide from. Together, we&#39;re the pointed end of a long stick of happenstance. Change one ripple in an ancient ocean and we would never have been granted the Light within us, or the good Ghosts that want to help us.<br/><br/>\nHumble origins.<br/><br/>\nEvery world begins as a big pebble lost among trillions of pebbles. Every worthy sun was once cold hydrogen spread thin across the vacuum. Even the universe, this cosmic garden that surrounds us and awes us...this monument to Creation was once the size of an apple seed. And everything that&#39;s splendid and great stands at the end of incalculable chance and mayhem.<br/><br/>\nYes, you have talents. Enormous, wondrous powers. But you should put the smirk away. Do you know what a Guardian is? Not yet. Your name is another pebble. You are a cold apple seed.<br/><br/>\nBut you will grow.",
