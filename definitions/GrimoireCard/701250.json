    "cardDescription": "You are a Centurion. Commander of the battlefield. The eye and the fist of the Cabal. The tough leather that binds the unit together.<br/><br/>\nYou have been taken.<br/><br/>\nBe quiet now. Nothing here needs your orders. Everything knows what it has to do.<br/><br/>\nWhat discipline binds you? What protocols guide your command?<br/><br/>\nThe unit depends on you. You guide them with your sensors. With your weapons you crack the enemy\u2019s strength and leave them in disarray. But you cannot control everything. The enemy can see your command. The enemy can claim the strong ground, move forward from cover, and kill you first.<br/><br/>\nYou must be sure there is always another threat.<br/><br/>\nThere is a knife for you. It is shaped like [it will find you].<br/><br/>\nTake up the knife. Push yourself upon it. Take your new shape.",
