I compel it. I will compare it to this shape.<br/><br/>\nSayeth Kagoor, World-Render, who split all moons<br/>\nMy joy is mastery, and dominion<br/>\nIt is the joy of rule<br/><br/>\nSayeth Kagoor, I compel the loyalty of all new flesh<br/>\nHuge and furious in its hunger<br/>\nThat which may not otherwise be commanded<br/>\nMy death is hidden in this sport<br/><br/>\nI rendered my decision against her, as Oryx, Geometer of Shapes<br/>\nIt was decided on the taste of her tribute<br/>\nUpon the shape of her sport<br/><br/>\nSayeth Crota, My Son<br/>\nI will raise new flesh that even Kagoor cannot rule.<br/>\nIn this way I will expand Our Might<br/><br/>\nThat is the count of My Court, O Yul<br/>\nListen to it carefully. It is my claim.",
