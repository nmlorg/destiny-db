    "cardDescription": "<b>RECORD 084-BRIDGE-10.7</b><br/><br/>\nRight When this time, wrong Where.  The world so big on the horizon \u2014 wasn&#39;t expecting it.  As it happens, something&#39;s here that&#39;s not supposed to be, other than myself.  Will return.<br/><br/><b>RECORD 092-BRIDGE-08.1</b><br/><br/>\nConfiguration worked, mostly.  Arrived under the surface, surrounded.  Too slow to return, barely fought to a vantage point.  Yes there is dark evil here, and not the one we chase.  Suggest no other attempts without more care.<br/><b>RECORD 120-BRIDGE-05.3</b><br/><br/>\nThey are feral on the surface but their intent is complex behind the teeth and claws.  More is shared with the machines than common enemies alone.<br/><br/><b>RECORD 142-BRIDGE-07.4</b><br/><br/>\nAn unexpected extraction.  These Guardians stopped some dark ritual before I could reach it.  Tearing the Light away... like the Garden.  Too similar to go uncharted.<br/><br/><b>RECORD 142-BRIDGE-08.1</b><br/><br/>\nThis attempt was precise \u2014 landed meters and minutes from prior ritual.  Confirmed the extraction was extinguished.  The Little Light mentioned Venus, we may have another.<br/><br/><b>RECORD 167 - BRIDGE - 5.2</b><br/><br/>\nSuccessfully observed Guardian discovery of Hive on Luna.  No evidence today of knowledge past Vex breaches here.  Delay in return command is a liability to solve before engaging this close again.<br/><br/><b>RECORD 312 - BRIDGE - 3.3</b><br/><br/>\nWatching Guardian-Hive engagements confirms a trajectory toward Earth.  This Moon is theirs \u2014 a breeding ground, their black heart, perhaps.  Different from that we know, but seems to be that same dark end I see us fall to over and over.<br/><br/><b>RECORD 472 - BRIDGE - 2.1</b><br/><br/>\nI&#39;ve followed this Light as far back as it goes.  Let the Little One guide me through Fallen as I puzzle out what the Hive want in the bones of this broken Cosmodrome.<br/><br/><b>RECORD 473 \u2013 BRIDGE - 1.2</b><br/><br/>\nBack to the Temple, again, but this time the Little one knows I&#39;m here. I have seen the failures of so many, but none have been as interesting.  Preparing to engage...",
