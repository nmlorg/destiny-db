    "cardDescription": "Timur\u2019s Stormtrance tears through a gang of Dregs as Felwinter stumbles through the shifting sands behind him, miles inland of what remains of the Arabian Shores. <br/><br/>\n\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Felwinter rushes to Timur\u2019s side, his eyes jumping focus, anticipating another attack. <br/><br/>\n\u201cYou seem far too obsessed with these \u2018Warminds\u2019.\u201d Timur stops and stares into the horizon as if smelling something; not danger, discovery.  He draws his fellow Iron Lord close. \u201cTell me, <i>Fel</i>winter,\u201d he whispers, \u201cwhat does the word <i>Seraph</i> mean to you?\u201d <br/><br/>\nFelwinter leans in to whisper back. \u201cOld Earth theology? I know its power well; one can make great use of the traps of faith and its myths.\u201d   <br/><br/>\n\u201cDamn you, Exos!\u201d The whisper game abandoned. \u201cDo you even ponder the before? Or that number etched into your \u2018flesh\u2019? Do you see yourself in your dreams? Th\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\nA shank. Then another, then more. Felwinter hits the ground and reaches for his sidearm. Timur hates interruptions and his face shows it. A wash of Arc Light grows in his hands and erupts as the pack of machine dogs falls nearly in unison. <br/><br/>\nTimur grabs Felwinter, bringing him back to his feet, and says, \u201cHave you ever wondered what it is that calls to you in that void of memory, where the edge of the past infects your present?\u201d He returns to his game of whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s an itch you can\u2019t scratch, isn\u2019t it? Well maybe you can.\u201d <br/><br/>\n\u201cYou think I am one of them? That all Exo are\u2014\u201d <br/><br/>\n\u201cLord Felwinter, I know what you are. And you are no Warmind or even one of its puppets. Come. You must see this.\u201d He makes a gesture like he\u2019s casting a spell over the sand. \u201cFollow my footfalls; this area\u2019s rigged with dirty Fallen nonsense.\u201d <br/><br/>\nThey struggle up the dunes. Felwinter glides ahead. As he lands, a sandstorm rises to meet him. More shanks. Hundreds of them. Behind them, a lone Vandal sniper lays down covering fire. <br/><br/>\nFelwinter, realizing his mistake, runs back toward Timur, shielding himself in the Light of suns. <br/><br/>\nTimur continues forward, grasps the brass familiar around his neck, and closes his eyes. A slight hum rises and his trance takes him deep into the sea of shanks, his trusted Lash raised and tearing his path through the darkness. Felwinter is slow to follow, but fast enough to witness Timur\u2019s focus turn shanks by the pack against their Vandal keeper, chasing him back toward the sea. <br/><br/>\nTimur rushes to Felwinter, examining his head with the intensity of a Cryptarch. <br/><br/>\n\u201cHmm. Warmind. You are certainly as stubborn as one.\u201d <br/><br/>\nFelwinter awkwardly pulls himself away and out of Timur\u2019s reach.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWith all respect, Lord Timur, whatever game you are playing with me has gone on far too long. This is just another Dead Zone.\u201d  <br/><br/>\n\u201cOh, is it?\u201d<br/><br/>\nTimur directs Felwinter\u2019s eyes toward the eastern horizon, where a building crowned with the initials \u201cC.B.\u201d is now in view.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe all have creators \u2014 humans, Exo, Warminds, even those poor Awoken. Some are just easier to find.\u201d",
