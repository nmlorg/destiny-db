    "cardDescription": "Oryx, my King, my friend. Kick back. Relax. Shrug off that armor, set down that blade. Roll your burdened shoulders and let down your guard. This is a place of life, a place of peace.<br/><br/>\nOut in the world we ask a simple, true question. A question like, can I kill you, can I rip your world apart? Tell me the truth. For if I don\u2019t ask, someone will ask it of me.<br/><br/>\nAnd they call us evil. Evil! Evil means \u2018socially maladaptive.\u2019 We are adaptiveness itself.<br/><br/>\nAh, Oryx, how do we explain it to them? The world is not built on the laws they love. Not on friendship, but on mutual interest. Not on peace, but on victory by any means. The universe is run by extinction, by extermination, by gamma-ray bursts burning up a thousand garden worlds, by howling singularities eating up infant suns. And if life is to live, if anything is to survive through the end of all things, it will live not by the smile but by the sword, not in a soft place but in a hard hell, not in the rotting bog of artificial paradise but in the cold hard self-verifying truth of that one ultimate arbiter, the only judge, the power that is its own metric and its own source\u2014existence, at any cost. Strip away the lies and truces and delaying tactics they call \u2018civilization\u2019 and this is what remains, this beautiful shape.<br/><br/>\nThe fate of everything is made like this, in the collision, the test of one praxis against another. This is how the world changes: one way meets a second way, and they discharge their weapons, they exchange their words and markets, they contest and in doing so they petition each other for the right to go on being something, instead of nothing. This is the universe figuring out what it should be in the end.<br/><br/>\nAnd it is majestic. Majestic. It is the only thing that can be true in and of itself.<br/><br/>\nAnd it is what I am.",
