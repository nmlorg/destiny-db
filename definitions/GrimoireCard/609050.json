    "cardDescription": "ARENA DESIGNATION: The Rusted Lands<br/>\nLOCATION: Eastern Flood Zone, Earth<br/><br/>\n&quot;The Hive never leaves the Moon.&quot; This is dogma - a way to soothe frightened children and reassure wary Guardians.<br/><br/>\nNot so long ago, a wandering Hunter and her Fireteam stumbled onto a feral community in the Eastern Flood Zone. The gaunt survivors huddled in these bombed-out ruins spoke of a terrible presence and begged for protection. No self-respecting Guardian could refuse.<br/><br/>\nAs night fell, the Guardians found themselves the hunted - stalked through the ruins by shapes of bone and shadow. The discovery of a Hive Seeder made the truth plain. Mankind&#39;s ancient enemy had come to Earth.<br/><br/>\nThe final confrontation came in the shadow of the Seeder, as a Hive Wizard and her Knights rose to challenge the Guardians. Only one Guardian returned to the City, her knife painted in black ash, a trail of grateful survivors in tow.<br/><br/>\nNow, in the chilling shadows of the Hive&#39;s pods, Guardians hone their skills in hopes that they may one day live up to the heroes of the Rusted Lands.",
