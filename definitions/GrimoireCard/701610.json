    "cardDescription": "\u201cAnother Prime, destroyed. Once sources of life, Light. Hope. Now a sign of decay. Machines as gods. <br/><br/>\nConspire with Kells. Conspire to kill, to conquer, to control.<br/><br/>\nThis will not end. There will always be new Kell. There will always be new Prime, yes? <br/><br/>\nSkolas was savage. Skolas was cruel. Skolas was ... right. Only Kell of Kells can end the slaughter. Only Kell of Kells can unite the Houses.<br/><br/>\nPetra has given House Judgement a great gift. Variks now speaks for Crows. Crows fly on black wings, find what House Judgment needs found.<br/><br/>\nHouse Judgement and the Reef are allies. Petra is a friend. The Crows will do as Petra needs. But they will also search for Variks, yes? They will find that which is lost.<br/><br/>\nThe Crows will find the Kell of Kells. Then Banners will rise as one. And Eliksni will stand together. Forever.\u201d",
