    "cardDescription": "Where are you going? No, wait, listen.<br/><br/>\nI was right, at first. In the ever-expanding Blighted-place, even Light must obey the sword-logic. Even you Guardians, you best and brightest of the dying dawn, you drew blood in honor of the Taken King. The Warpriest did his duty, and you did yours. Oryx was challenged, yes, but challenged in the way of the Hive, which is to say that challenge is worship \u2014 is challenge \u2014 is power. Sword-logic. You played your part well.<br/><br/>\nYou were not supposed to touch the Light.<br/><br/>\nHow did you find your way into the King&#39;s Cellars? How did you even recognize that benighted draught for what it was? Do you not know that the Hive pursue Light precisely for the purpose of devouring it with slavering jaws and slick greedy gulping throats? How did you take (or rather, un-Take) the Blighted Light that Oryx gathered to offer in sacrifice to Akka, and ignite it so that it burned and burned the Darkness?<br/><br/>\nIt was barely Light anymore. But you took it. And when you took it, you did not keep it. You set it free.<br/><br/>\nYou fools! You <i>disastrous, bumbling squanderers!</i> It&#39;s not right! Who now shall be First Navigator, Lord of Shapes, harrowed god, Taken King? Not you! You might have been Kings and Queens of the Deep! But you have toppled Oryx and you have not replaced him!<br/><br/>\nThere must be a strongest one. It is the architecture of these spaces.<br/><br/>\nWhy are you leaving?",
