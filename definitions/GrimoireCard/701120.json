    "cardDescription": "Prey and Sacrifice \u2014<br/>\nUttered by Xivu Arath \u2014<br/>\nGod of War \u2014<br/><br/>\nHARMONY. When the Traveler passed across Harmony, it lied to the orbits of ten worlds. Now they orbit the black hole. The Traveler lied to the accretion disc, so that it would give warm light to these worlds.<br/><br/>\nTHE GIFT MAST. When the Traveler left Harmony, it made a monument out of the black hole\u2019s polar jet. In the jet there is a hollow mast which sings in radiance. This is the Gift Mast and we will devour it, we will eat the Sky out of it, we will snap it like a bone.<br/><br/>\nTHE HARMONY STING. The Harmony have weaponized their dead star. They can stimulate the accretion disc to fire relativistic plasma jets. We will take the Sting. We will use it to burn their worlds. I will grant one temple of tribute to the first Ascendant to kill a world!<br/><br/>\nORYX. I will have the Gift Mast to feast on! I will have it first! I am Xivu Arath and all war is my temple. Beware the daughters of Oryx, for they make and unmake with ease.<br/><br/>\nSAVATH&#219;N. The Deceitful Sister will be distracted by arcana and the song of the black hole. Treat her broods with contempt.<br/><br/>\nTHE TRAVELER. We chase it and we will devour it. The Deep will rule the cosmos.<br/><br/>\nTHE DRAGONS. Our gods should be ours alone. Their smug freedom is an insult to me. I\u2019d shut them all in cells. Bring them to me!",
