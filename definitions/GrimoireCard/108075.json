    "cardDescription": "&quot;No discounts, big shot.&quot;<br/><br/>\nArcite 99-40 is the last of Lord Shaxx&#39;s personal combat frames. When he chose to remain in the City to oversee the Crucible, Shaxx had Arcite&#39;s combat systems deactivated and rebooted with the Tower&#39;s more civil vendor protocols.<br/><br/>\nArcite&#39;s memory banks still remember the battles he has seen. This knowledge makes Arcite uniquely qualified to equip Guardians for combat. His outward disdain for untested Guardians is a combination of learned behavior - a byproduct of years in service to Lord Shaxx - and personal experience. His systems may have been reprogrammed, but the love for combat still pulses within his circuitry.",
