    "cardDescription": "<i>He always survives.</i><br/><br/>\nHelmet in one hand and torch in the other, Saladin Forge marches through the snow. He can sense the wolves emerge around him; only three of them come into view, but this group has followed him on his patrols since the Devils raided the Plaguelands. He has given up dissuading them. They\u2019re defending their territory, and Saladin can relate to that. But they will not last long.<br/><br/>\nNothing does. Not the Golden Age. Not the colony ships. Not the impenetrable walls of the Cosmodrome.<br/><br/>\nNot the Iron Lords.<br/><br/>\nHe discards his torch, and glances up to see a familiar glow reaching out from the dark. He smirks. A horde of Devil Splicers returns his stare from the wreckage of the wall ahead.<br/><br/>\nThe Splicers are doomed. Just as the Iron Lords were, when he and his allies opened that vault. As Fallen continue to pour through the gap in the wall, they remind him of his friends in their final moment: a crimson pulse beats in place of their hearts. <i>SIVA.</i><br/><br/>\nHe puts his helmet on as an Iron battle axe forms in his hand, the air around him bursting into flame. The first wave of dregs approaches. Saladin breaks into a charge, swinging the axe to bear as he smashes into a storm of steel and weapons fire.<br/><br/>\nAs his axe bites, again and again, Skorri\u2019s Iron Song haunts him. He calls upon Radegast\u2019s strength. Perun\u2019s sense of purpose. Timur\u2019s questions. Felwinter\u2019s cynicism. Silimar\u2019s persistence. Gheleon\u2019s reasoning. <br/><br/>\nJolder\u2019s smile. <br/><br/>\nHe pounds the last Splicer priest like a burning hammer, blasting a crater into the snow and gravel. Frozen dirt rains down on the spent shells and the mounds of Splicer corpses that surround him. The Warlocks of the City have described meditation to him. He imagines it feels like this.<br/><br/><i>He always survives. When nothing else does.</i><br/><br/>\n\u201cLord Saladin? What\u2019s your status?\u201d calls Shiro-4 through his audio feed.<br/><br/>\n\u201cJust\u2014 Taking a walk,\u201d he says, staring at the fifteen-foot divide he broke in the earth. He had to meet SIVA again. One last time.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ve analyzed the Clovis Bray data.\u201d<br/><br/><i>Timur always said that Clovis Bray was the key. </i><br/><br/>\n\u201cCan you break the Splicers\u2019 hold over SIVA?\u201d<br/><br/><i>How different would things be, had Saladin listened?</i><br/><br/>\n\u201cTheoretically. Temporarily.\u201d<br/><br/><i>Would his friends still live? Would he?</i><br/><br/>\n\u201cIt might be enough. Perhaps our Guardian has turned the tide. I\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe sees the wolves have formed up around him. Eight of them.<br/><br/><i>He always survives.</i>",
