    "cardDescription": "\u201cI have a gift for you,\u201d says Oryx.<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n, Witch-Queen, looks at him with dry wariness. \u201cIs it the sword logic I need to go into the Deep, and take your power for myself?\u201d<br/><br/>\nTheir echoes move among the war-moons, walking together on the hull of a two-thousand-year-old warship. Savath&#251;n\u2019s fleet has assembled here, in preparation for an assault on the Gift Mast. The Deep is headed that way, on the trail of its prey, and the Hive will be its vanguard.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Vex I captured. Quria, Blade Transform. It made an attempt to puncture my throne. I thought you might enjoy studying it.\u201d Oryx pauses, digesting \u2014 through the bond of lineage he can feel Crota killing, worlds and worlds away, and it tastes like sweet fat. \u201cQuria contains a Vex attempt to simulate me. It might generate others \u2014 you, perhaps, or Xivu Arath. I\u2019ve left it some will of its own, so it can surprise you.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019ll blow up and kill me,\u201d Savath&#251;n grouses. \u201cOr let the machines into my throne, where they\u2019ll start turning everything into clocks and glass.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIf it kills you, then you deserve to die.\u201d Oryx says it with a quiet thrill, a happy thrill, because it is good to say the truth.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a strict proof yet, you know.\u201d Savath&#251;n strokes the void with one long claw and space-time groans beneath her touch. \u201cThis thing we believe \u2014 that we\u2019re liberating the universe by devouring it, that we\u2019re cutting out the rot, that we\u2019re on course to join the final shape \u2014 I haven\u2019t found a strict, eternal proof. We might yet be wrong.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx looks at her and for a moment, just a moment, he is nostalgic, he is sentimental. He thinks, imagine the years behind us, the things we\u2019ve done. And yet being old doesn\u2019t feel like a scar, does it? It hasn\u2019t left me dull. I feel alive, alive with you, and every time I step back into this world from my throne I feel like I\u2019m two years old again, at the bottom of the universe, looking up.<br/><br/>\nBut he says, \u201cSister, it\u2019s us. We\u2019re the proof, we the Hive: if we last forever, we prove it, and if something more ruthless conquers us, then the proof is sealed.\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe looks back at him with eyes like hot needles. \u201cI like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s elegant.\u201d Although of course she has had this thought before.",
