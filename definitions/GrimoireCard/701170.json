    "cardDescription": "What will happen if I die?<br/><br/>\nIt suits me to consider this, for I am a great ally of death. My daughters study the quiddity of death, my son practices the inhabitation of death, and my great work is, in ultima, to become synonymous with death, to die and in that dying live, so that if the universe comes to nothing then I will be a part of that nothing. Far better to have a savage universe with a happy end than a happy universe with no hope.<br/><br/>\nI have died many times but these deaths were only temporary.<br/><br/>\nIf my echoes are killed, and I am killed in the material world, then I will be driven back to my throne the Dreadnaught. If my Court and my throne can be beaten, if I am confronted in my throne, if I am defeated there, then I will die. My work will end.<br/><br/>\nThis is the pact to which I am bound, in particular by my study of the Tablets of Ruin, and by my use of the power of the Deep. When I call upon that power, I put myself up as the stakes in a wager, I gamble with my soul. For I am saying, listen, my gods, I am the mightiest thing there is, and I prove it thus.<br/><br/>\nLately I have realized how much I depend on Crota and my daughters, and even upon my court. If I lost them, my outlays would exceed my intakes, my tribute would not be enough to feed my worm. But this is proper \u2014 for if I lost them it would be because they were not mighty enough, and then I would be a bad father, a bad King. I must test them and fight with them, to keep them strong. This is my geas.<br/><br/>\nI will go on forever. I will understand everything. There is only one path and that is the path that you make. But you can make more than one path.<br/><br/>\nBreak your cell\u2019s bars. Make a new shape, make the shape from its path, find your cell\u2019s bars, break out of the bars, find a shape, make the shape from its path, eat the light, eat the path.<br/><br/>\nIf I fail, let me be wormfood.",
