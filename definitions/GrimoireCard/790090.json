    "cardDescription": "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the same reports I have, and more,\u201d Petra said. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I know the Crows whisper secrets to you that you don\u2019t pass along to the rest of us.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cVariks is loyal to Reef,\u201d the scribe of House Judgment protested. \u201cHelps Petra. Honors vows made to his Kell.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m not doubting your loyalty. I\u2019m stating a fact. And the facts are that...\u201d She sighed. \u201cThat we can\u2019t keep fighting this war. Not alone. The Techeuns are in mourning. We&#39;ve made some advances, but it&#39;s not enough.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cPetra wants to avenge her Queen, yes?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cPetra wants every Taken in the galaxy dead! We will spill every drop of whatever it is they call blood, burn the Dreadnaught, salt the ground...\u201d Petra stopped. Her shoulders slumped in defeat. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do it alone. And I won\u2019t go begging.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe have lost our Queen,\u201d she continued. \u201cOur prince is missing. Our numbers are few. But we still have our pride. We still have that much.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cMake Guardians want to help,\u201d Variks said.<br/><br/>\n\u201cHow?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cGuardians desire many things,\u201d Variks said. \u201cGlory. Honor. Treasure. Open the vaults again. Show them gifts we give to the worthy. They will come, and we will not have to ask.\u201d",
