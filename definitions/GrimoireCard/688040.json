    "cardDescription": "The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 3<br/><br/>\nAbstract:<br/>\nWith Skolas and Parixas still fighting, no one expected either to attack the Reef. So by the time Paladin Abra Zire arrived at Amethyst it was too late: the Silent Fang, led by Drevis herself had massacred almost everyone in the station, including Coven Leader Pinar Venj.<br/><br/>\nPaladin Zire gave chase, and followed the Fang to Iris, where, behind the glare of Iris&#39; brightness, a Wolf ketch lay in wait. But the ketch was no match for Zire&#39;s smaller, faster ships, or her ferocity.<br/><br/>\nWhen the Battle of Iris was over, however, it was not Drevis at Zire&#39;s&#39; feet. It was Parixas.<br/><br/>\nGrayor, another of Skolas&#39; loyal vassals, had attacked Parixas&#39; ketch at the same time that Drevis had attacked Amethyst. He, too, had lured Parixas to Iris, then the Silent Fang had used Iris&#39; unusual brightness to disappear just as Zire and Parixas arrived in the system.",
