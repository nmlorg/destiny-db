    "cardDescription": "Two more scans and she could move on to the elevated grid. There wasn&#39;t really anything new other than the delta to sea level, but at less than 30% of the way through 2^128 scans, even a distinction without a difference could feel like a brand new shell.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Cassiopeia!&quot;<br/><br/>\nSo numb after months with just her own scans for company. She didn&#39;t even pick up on another Ghost being this close. &quot;Obverse? Wait. I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re... Obsidian! Wow, how long has it been?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Well, I mean...&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I know. It&#39;s been 6.8 years. It&#39;s just an expression.&quot;<br/><br/>\nObsidian floated closer. &quot;That&#39;s okay. It HAS been a while. I guess you haven&#39;t found yours yet?&quot;<br/><br/>\nCassiopeia projected glumness. &quot;Not yet. But I haven&#39;t been looking on Mars for that long, at least! I&#39;m optimistic.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;You should be! I was just at the City last year. A lot more of us are starting to find our Guardians latel\u2014 what&#39;s that?&quot;<br/><br/>\nCassiopeia resolved to run a full-range self-diagnostic before the next grid. Two Ghosts within twenty meters and she didn&#39;t sense either one? Something was off.<br/><br/>\nThe new arrival chirped and spoke up. &quot;Hello, you two! I&#39;m glad ~identify(OBSIDIAN)~ to see a friendly face! I haven&#39;t been myself lately.&quot;<br/><br/>\nObsidian looked at Cassiopeia. He read as nervous. She probably did, too.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I was beneath the Blind Watch for a while. A long ~SIVA.MEM.GH404~ while. It was fun! There were puzzles. No one was alive down there, though.&quot;<br/><br/>\nCassiopeia&#39;s scan of the new Ghost returned nothing amiss. &quot;Are you okay, friend?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m great! Something got in me but the Light ~if (LIGHT) then WARNING~ burned it away. It&#39;s gone forever, now! ~consume: FAILURE replicate:FAILURE enhance:FAILURE~&quot;<br/><br/>\nThere was silence for a full three seconds. Then Obsidian spoke up, his words coming quickly.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Well, great to see you again, Cassiopeia! Good luck!&quot; He zipped away.<br/><br/>\nCassiopeia watched him disappear into the horizon. &quot;TWO self-diagnostics,&quot; she muttered.",
