    "cardDescription": "Rezyl Azzir was a man.<br/><br/>\nIn time his kind would be called Titan. Mountains of muscle and might and metal. His collar was fur and teeth. His person clad in ornate, golden-etched plating, trophies upon his shoulders.<br/><br/>\nThis was before the City was The City.<br/><br/>\nThis is before the walls. Still in the shadow of the fragile giant above, but before.<br/><br/>\nSalvation seekers came \u2014 survivors; weary remnants of a people on the brink.<br/><br/>\nThese were the days before reason took hold. Before study was merged with belief.<br/><br/>\nThe giant was looked to as one would a God.  Maybe it still is.<br/><br/>\nFactions grew from the huddled masses. Like minds coming together to provide support, comfort. Over time these loyalties demanded loyalty. Differences that used to inform \u2014 viewpoints that when joined granted a larger understanding of the whole \u2014 became points of conflict. The sanctuary became divided. The shadow of Light grew darker. This, humanity\u2019s last oasis, slowly fading to a mirage.<br/><br/>\nGreat, powerful men and women, The Risen, stood at the Factions\u2019 sides. Protection. Enforcers. Misused possibility.<br/><br/>\nMisery crept into this false paradise. Yet hope lingered.<br/><br/>\nSeeing the cracks in this society born beneath the giant\u2019s fractured shell, some among The Risen challenged the dissolution of all that could be. They would no longer serve as instruments of oppression. They would be more.<br/><br/>\nThus began an unnecessary war made necessary by greed, ambition... fear. And, in the chaos of this struggle, came the scavengers \u2014 aliens with appetites. A common enemy.<br/><br/>\nIn the end, the scavengers were repelled and the Factions fell, their grip broken, though their beliefs remained. This was the earliest days of the Guardians, when might found purpose. Prosperity was in reach.<br/><br/>\nRezyl had been a champion of these wars. A leader. Against the alien pirates he had been more. If the giant wasn\u2019t a God, then maybe Rezyl was.<br/><br/>\nAs the first walls formed \u2014 built of hard work and sacrifice \u2014 Rezyl and the Guardians stood against the alien plunderers time and again. More survivors arrived. More warriors.<br/><br/>\nThe Guardian ranks swelled.<br/><br/>\nThe City grew.<br/><br/>\nHope blossomed. To Rezyl it was a currency. Hope bought tomorrow. Tomorrow bought the effort needed to survive today.<br/><br/>\nYet Rezyl grew weary. Stories haunted his nights. Old stories. Those no longer told. Those locked behind tight lips for fear of what they may invoke. Whenever the sun dropped below the horizon and the moon rose high, Rezyl\u2019s thoughts wandered. How safe was safe? How long could they fight with the Darkness still writhing?<br/><br/>\nSo, every day Rezyl would fight and build and protect. And every day a city grew beneath the giant. And every night he would think about all that was never said and stare intently at the moon above.",
