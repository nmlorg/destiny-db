He was administered the standard medication but refused to enter the Device. <br/><br/>\nAren&#39;t people unpredictable? I suppose there&#39;d be no point if they weren&#39;t, would there? <br/><br/>\nHe knows to keep silent. <br/><br/>\nEND RECORD <br/><br/>\nRECORD 343-CHASM-7888<br/><br/>\nSubject twenty-three entered the Device at 11:00. A clever girl from the Core District; an artist, before she joined the War Cult. <br/><br/>\nAt 11:03 she reported a sensation of floating. At 11:06, a sensation of lights within the darkness of the Device. Between 11:06 and 11:32 she reported these lights variously as white, golden, and blood-red. At 11:32 she reported a sensation of someone taking her hand; a stranger, but also herself. Twelve subjects have reported similar experiences. At 11:33 she reported the sensation we have called &quot;The Opening Of The Veil.&quot; The Device recorded temporal displacement of her consciousness to the order of six degrees. At seven she began screaming. Brainscans near-death. Removed from the Device at 11:34. <br/><br/>\nShe believes without question that the Device granted her a vision of the future, and that it was one of utter Darkness. She thanked me for this enlightenment. She says it will make her stronger.<br/><br/>\nLittle Ghost, there in the corner of the Sanctum - I see you blinking. Are you listening? Are y -<br/><br/>\nEND RECORD<br/><br/>\nRECORD 343-CHASM-7889<br/>\nthe Device at 12:22 and immediately the Device reported displacement of his consciousness. Visions of war and the City in flames. Subject twenty-nine worked the supply channels on the Slip before he joined the War Cult. By 12:27 he was babbling and by<br/>\nEND RECORD<br/><br/>\nRECORD 343-CHASM-7890<br/>\nWe have applied certain refinements to the Device. Novarro found records of a prototype of the Device at a Golden Age laboratory in Tibet, and Hari&#39;s team retrieved what was left of it. We are the first to see it operational in who knows how long.<br/>\nToo many subjects come back damaged. Mad. We are grasping at straws. <br/>\nWhat do you think, little Ghost?<br/>\nEND RECORD<br/><br/>\nRECORD 343-CHASM-7891<br/><br/>\nForty-seven human subjects; eleven report timelines in which the Darkness has already prevailed, thirteen report timelines in which the City has fallen. Twenty-three babbled madness. Hopeless. Trapped.<br/><br/>\nNo wonder the Device was abandoned. The human mind is too weak for it. Too weak to look into the Future, or to understand what it sees. <br/><br/>\nWhat the situation calls for, little Ghost, is a better sort of witness. <br/><br/>\nWe found you in pieces in Siberia, and repaired you as well as we could. <br/><br/>\nWhat do you say? Are you well enough to travel?<br/><br/>\nEND RECORD",
