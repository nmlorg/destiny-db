    "cardDescription": "Images flicker in and out repeatedly over its length. The result is a series of tableaus, moments in time captured by the Ghost&#39;s struggle to see what&#39;s going on:<br/><br/>\n- The face of an Exo, staring impassively down at the Ghost from very close.  He appears to be confused, unsure what he is looking at.<br/><br/>\n- A landscape, from a position a few feet off the ground, moving laterally to the point of view.  The Ghost appears to be clipped to the Exo&#39;s belt.  The image is of a battlefield, and over two dozen Exo soldiers can be seen marshalling for battle.<br/><br/>\n- A chaotic scene of Vex and Exos fighting a titanic battle.  The backdrop is a pitted and scarred landscape, a planet unidentifiable from present context.  Vex energy bolts hang in midair as the frames click by, teeming masses of constructs surging towards an entrenched line of Exo soldiers.<br/><br/>\n- A metallic leg and boot, belonging to a Vex Goblin.  The Exo goes down.<br/><br/>\n- The horizon of this battle-scarred world, the Ghost kicked free of the Exo&#39;s body.  Most details are obscured by dark and shadow, but one detail is easily made out: a massive crashed spacecraft.  The last image: a sigil of Golden Age Earth, emblazoned on the side of the ship&#39;s prow.",
