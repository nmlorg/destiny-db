    "cardDescription": "Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m a nihilist.<br/><br/>\nI don\u2019t do much except break things. That\u2019s what they say about me: we could\u2019ve had a great civilization, if it weren\u2019t for that damn Oryx, that damn Hive. They don\u2019t believe in anything but death.<br/><br/>\nThe only way to make something good is to make something that can\u2019t be broken. And the only way to do that is to try to break everything.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019m glad I learned that the universe runs on death. It\u2019s more beautiful to know.<br/><br/>\nBut I\u2019m lost somewhere strange.<br/><br/>\nI think that Savath&#251;n and Xivu Arath are trying to steal the tablets from me. They must have cut off my tribute while I was away communing with the Deep. I love them so dearly. No one else is clever or strong enough to try to break me. No one else can give me this gift.<br/><br/>\nOnce, long ago, I killed Xivu Arath on her war moon, and she blew up the whole moon to kill with me her. She was laughing in joy. I laughed too. A whole moon! A whole moon. It was a waste of a moon, but it taught me how to save myself from exploding worlds, which was necessary to fight the Ecumene.<br/><br/>\nI love mighty Xivu more than a moon loves the tide. I\u2019ll kill her for this. Over and over, forever and ever.<br/><br/>\nWhen I get home from my wanderings in the Deep, and I take back my throne, I\u2019m going to have children. That\u2019s what I need.<br/><br/>\nSons and daughters to love and kill.",
