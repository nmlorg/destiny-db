    "cardDescription": "The Syzygy \u2014<br/>\nCarved to endure by Aurash \u2014<br/>\nThe high vengeance \u2014<br/><br/>\nOnly Xi Ro\u2019s bait stars let us escape. Only Sathona\u2019s tricks let us reach the coast. But now that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am the navigator.<br/><br/>\nWe may never see our homes again. Xi Ro seethes with hate and fury for Taox.<br/><br/>\nBut this is my deepest fear \u2014<br/><br/>\nOur civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thousands of other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move us all.<br/><br/>\nThe Timid Truth says that we are the smallest, most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the universe. Taox would have us believe that our ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the hungry void.<br/><br/>\nMy father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to me \u2014<br/><br/>\n\u201cAurash, my first daughter! The moons are different! The laws are bent!\u201d<br/><br/>\nAnd he made the sign of a syzygy.<br/><br/>\nImagine the fifty-two moons of Fundament lining up in the sky. (It wouldn\u2019t take all fifty-two, of course: just a few massive moons. But this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a swollen bulge...<br/><br/>\nImagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy passed. A wave big enough to swallow civilizations. A God-Wave.<br/><br/>\nI have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-Wave annihilates my species. If I could only get back into my father\u2019s orrery, I could learn exactly when!<br/><br/>\nWe are weeks of travel and many continents away from home.<br/><br/>\nWhen I\u2019m paralyzed by fear, Xi Ro sits in the cabin with me and comforts me with soft, brave words. But more and more we have come to rely on Sathona\u2019s wit. She will go off to be alone (she insists she must be alone) and return with some mad idea \u2014 steer into the storm, throw down a net, eat that strange beast, explore that menacing wreck.<br/><br/>\nSomehow Sathona seems to manufacture good luck by sheer will.",
