    "cardDescription": "Jolyon was a Crow. He&#39;d seen much. More than most. He held the enemy&#39;s greatest weapon. Remembered its burn.  Then began tinkering. He liked things. Liked how they worked. Found happiness in finding new avenues through which a thing could function. Not to alter the purpose, but simply to refine it.<br/><br/>\nThe weapon delivered impact with incredible force spread over a range to increase its area of influence. But what if that force was brought to focus in a directed burst. A seasoned marksman with a steady, strong hand could deliver a burn that served less to herd, more to punish.<br/><br/>\nThe feral ones deserved nothing less. The Wolves would have a new master. And that master was fire.",
