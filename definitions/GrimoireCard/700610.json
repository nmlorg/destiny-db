    "cardDescription": "Today, Primus Ta\u2019aun leads from the front.<br/><br/>\nHe pounds from bunker to bunker, roaring encouragement. \u201cYou\u2019re my cornerstone!\u201d he tells a wounded Centurion, grabbing her by her armored shoulders. \u201cBear the weight!\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe gets back up, into the fight. \u201cCome on!\u201d Tlu\u2019urn snaps at him, running along behind Ta\u2019aun and saying all the cruel things his commander can\u2019t. \u201cYou don\u2019t need two arms to fight!\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe calls for fire support. Artillery shrieks overhead. On the plains below the Cabal perimeter, Vex march out of the lightning. Torch hammers burst up like mortars and Ta\u2019aun and his bond brother duck behind a burning Interceptor for cover.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThis is going well,\u201d Tlu\u2019urn rumbles.<br/><br/>\nA Vex particle beam needles a little hole through the Centurion\u2019s helmet. He falls dead. Goblins swarm over her bunker and then the Goliath tank supporting this bastion fires a main gun round into the mess, killing the Vex, the bunker, and all the Legionaries inside. The concussion knocks Tlu\u2019urn against his Primus.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAbout as well as expected,\u201d Ta\u2019aun grunts. Tlu\u2019urn laughs.<br/><br/>\nThe grind is eternal. Like duty. Ta\u2019aun keeps fighting, out here past the edge of the Empire, because failure is unthinkable. Defeat\u2019s much worse than death.<br/><br/>\nBut Ta\u2019aun is so, so tired.<br/><br/>\nTlu\u2019urn gets up and starts shooting Vex. \u201cYou\u2019re not really going to do it.\u201d Even though he\u2019s fully armored, and only a meter away, his voice on the com crashes with static. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to go. It\u2019s mad.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Vex Hobgoblins start firing at Tlu\u2019urn.<br/><br/>\nParticle beams scream and spark off his enormous bulk. Ta\u2019aun yanks him back to cover. A maniple of Phalanx troops rush forward to plug the gap. \u201cI have my orders. Our report went all the way up, and the decision came all the way back.\u201d<br/><br/>\nValus Tlu\u2019urn\u2019s blank helmet swivels to stare. \u201cYou mean \u2014 ?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt came from the Emperor Himself.\u201d Ta\u2019aun can feel the pressure gel pumping against his skin, keeping him insulated from this deadly world, keeping him alive. \u201cI\u2019m ordered to board and capture the Hive flagship. At any cost.\u201d<br/><br/>\nA Vex Minotaur blinks up behind the Phalanx line. Primus Ta\u2019aun\u2019s armor paints the target and he absolutely unloads, putting all his fear and anger and sorrow into the wretched machine. He roars and roars. The Minotaur burns.<br/><br/>\nHis soldiers cheer.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s a job for an elite unit. Not a few scout legions bogged down in attrition war. We should wait until \u2014 \u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s the mission I\u2019ve been given. I will use what I have.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cMutiny,\u201d Tlu\u2019urn whispers. \u201cYou should mutiny.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOh, to mutiny. To be like Valus Trau\u2019ug, who took his Broken Legion against the Reef \u2014 and failed, failed utterly.<br/><br/>\nDuty is victory. Mutiny is worse than death. Even if death seems certain.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ta\u2019aun says. And that\u2019s that.<br/><br/>\nThe Vex are falling back. Together, they\u2019ve held the line.",
