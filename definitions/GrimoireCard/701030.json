    "cardDescription": "You are Crota, my son. Welcome.<br/><br/>\nI fought my way out of hell to make you. I fought my traitor siblings and I fought the swarming corpse of Akka and I cut my way back into my own court, the High War, which had been usurped. Once I had made war on Savath&#251;n, and crippled her tribute so that she could never challenge me, and once I had tricked Xivu Arath, and poisoned her tribute so that she could never again try to take my tablets, and once I had arranged my own lineages so that I would be greatest among the Hive and secure on my throne \u2014 then I found a mother to make spawn.<br/><br/>\nOne of those spawn was you.<br/><br/>\nYour life will be a battle too. You will have to win your place at the High War. I will give you nothing... except this, your first sword, and this name I have prepared for you.<br/><br/>\nWe fight a war against false hope, Crota. We chase a god called the Traveler, a huckster god who baits young life into building houses for it. These houses are unsafe, for they cannot stand against my Hive. And these houses are a trap \u2014 for they lead young life away from the blade and the tooth, which are the tools of survival and the means of ascension.<br/><br/>\nOnly when the Traveler is extinguished will the universe be free to arrange itself, and assume, by ruthless contest, its final perfect shape, a shape which depends on nothing but itself.<br/><br/>\nThus I name you Crota, Eater of Hope.<br/><br/>\nThere is an oath upon me, Crota my son, an oath against the wretched Taox. This I do not give to you. It is for me, your father, to bear.<br/><br/>\nLet\u2019s go meet your aunts and uncles.",
