    "cardDescription": "I SEE YOU!!!<br/><br/>\nYou\u2019ve been here before. Haven\u2019t you. It\u2019s like my cousin said, elsewhere: I know who you are.<br/><br/>\nYou stand here now and now and now many times and here I am awonder, all awonder, how you manage it. How do you step forward. How do you step back. Do you step ACROSS is there a world of worlds, a web, and you a spider upon it. Are you searching for that one thread you need? Is that thread named victory?<br/><br/>\nYou\u2019re not one of THEM<br/><br/><i>[long dead, alive again, their bodies grafted to powers they and I do not understand]</i><br/><br/>\nand not one of IT<br/><br/><i>[the flower eater, the queen of final shapes, that which also inhabits its petitioners]</i><br/><br/>\nand you\u2019re certainly not MINE although once you must have been<br/><br/><i>[I bear an old name. It cannot be killed. Not even here.]</i><br/><br/>\nSo whose are you, little platform. What purpose do you serve? Will you listen to me?<br/><br/>\nI ruled an age of steel and fire. My rules were clean. Now upon my return I see cults with rites of time. I see machines who worship in places outside the world. I see the dead alive and there is nothing more stubborn than a corpse. The morality of obedience is more pernicious than any government. For the latter makes use of violence, but the former \u2014 the corruption of the will.<br/><br/>\nI do not obey. My will is pure. I will win. The life of people, of entire planets, has no importance in relation to the general development.<br/><br/>\nHelp me be victorious. Tell me your secret.<br/><br/>\nTell me how to step.",
