    "cardDescription": "SUNDARESH: I have a plan.<br/><br/>\nESI: If you have a plan, then so does your sim, and the Vex knows about it.<br/><br/>\nDUANE-MCNIADH: Does it matter? If we&#39;re in Vex hell right now, there&#39;s nothing we can -<br/><br/>\nSHIM: Stop talking about &#39;real&#39; and &#39;unreal.&#39; All realities are programs executing laws. Subjectivity is all that matters.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: We have to act as if we&#39;re in the real universe, not one simulated by the specimen. Otherwise we might as well give up.<br/><br/>\nESI: Your sim self is saying the same thing.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: Chioma, love, please hush. It doesn&#39;t help.<br/><br/>\nDUANE-MCNIADH: Maybe the simulations are just billboards! Maybe they don&#39;t have interiority! It&#39;s bluffing!<br/><br/>\nSHIM: I wish someone would simulate you shutting up.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: If we&#39;re sims, we exist in the pocket of the universe that the Vex specimen is able to simulate with its onboard brainpower. If we&#39;re real, we need to get outside that bubble.<br/><br/>\nESI: ...we call for help.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: That&#39;s right. We bring in someone smarter than the specimen. Someone too big to simulate and predict. A warmind.<br/><br/>\nSHIM: In the real world, the warmind will be able to behave in ways the Vex can&#39;t simulate. It&#39;s too smart. The warmind may be able to get into the Vex and rescue - us.<br/><br/>\nDUANE-MCNIADH: If we try, won&#39;t the Vex torture us for eternity? Or just erase us?<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: It may simply erase us. But I feel that&#39;s preferable to...the alternatives.<br/><br/>\nESI: I agree.<br/><br/>\nSHIM: Once we try to make the call, the Vex may...react. So let&#39;s all savor this last moment of stability.<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: [indistinct sounds]<br/><br/>\nSHIM: You two are adorable.<br/><br/>\nDUANE-MCNIADH: I wish I&#39;d taken that job at Clovis.",
