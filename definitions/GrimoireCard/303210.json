    "cardDescription": "Imagine: you live in the largest territory in the system. A huge torus of habitable, explorable space. But there&#39;s a catch. That huge space is made up of millions and millions of nooks and crannies. Asteroids. Crumbling derelicts. Debris from dozens of wars. It&#39;s a place where you could go for thousands\u2014millions\u2014of miles without ever seeing another friendly face, and yet never once be able to stretch your legs.<br/><br/>\nNow imagine: you&#39;re spelunking across an asteroid, or crawling through a half-collapsed ship that could be hundreds of years old. You won&#39;t see enemies coming, not in a tight corner like that. Won&#39;t hear &#39;em or smell &#39;em either, not in the void. But then you move, or they move, and there you both are.<br/><br/>\nRifles, shotguns, they aren&#39;t gonna cut it. You don&#39;t have room to heft a barrel of that length. Don&#39;t have the arm room to throw a knife or a grenade either. But what you do have is a sidearm at your hip. Small enough for a fast draw, strong enough to save your life.<br/><br/>\nThat&#39;s why the Queen sends out every last Corsair with a Vestian Dynasty sidearm at our hips. And Vestian Dynasty is what gets us home again too.",
