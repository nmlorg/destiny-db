    "cardDescription": "Now in this time of diaspora there was a war between AURYX and SAVATH&#219;N and XIVU ARATH.<br/><br/>\nBrother Auryx, said SAVATH&#219;N, do not forgive my betrayal. Instead, take vengeance upon me for what I did at the dry moon! And AURYX made war on her, in worship of the Deep. Between them stood XIVU ARATH saying, stop, or I will kill you, war is mine and I am strongest.<br/><br/>\nThis was how they worshipped.<br/><br/>\nFor twenty thousand years they fought across the moons and they fought in the abyssal plains and lightning palaces of each other&#39;s sword spaces. And they killed each other again and again, so that they could practice death.<br/><br/>\nSuch was their love.<br/><br/>\nAt last the many moons came to many worlds and it was time to go to war on life. AURYX said, I shall establish a court, and whoever comes into this court may challenge me. My court will be the High War. It will be a killing ground and a school of the sword logic we have learned from our gods.<br/><br/>\nSAVATH&#219;N thought this was a great idea. She made a court called the High Coven. XIVU ARATH said, the world is my court, wherever there is war.",
