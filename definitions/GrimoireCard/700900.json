    "cardDescription": "I killed my sister today.<br/><br/>\nShe came to this star to oversee the extermination of all life here. The Qugu are a strong power, and their fleets protect four nearby stars. As herd animals they are loyal and stubborn. But they do show grace.<br/><br/>\nFor millions of years of evolution the Qugu have been infected by a virus so insidious that it wrote itself into their genome. The virus compels them to offer their limbs for amputation by enormous sessile jaw-beasts. They venerate these beasts and treat them as gods. The virus converts Qugu cells into eggs, from which strange crawling things pupate, to live within the jaw-beast gut. In turn the jaw-beast extrudes sweet nectar for the Qugu to drink, and they have brilliant visions.<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n and her broods have liberated the Qugu from jaw-beasts, and indeed from existence. But as they chased the Qugu ark-ships, I stopped in to vaporize my sister\u2019s warship and a few of her underlings. I want to dwell on the ruins a while, and punish Savath&#251;n for failing to guard her flank.<br/><br/>\nThey are like us, these Qugu. Bound in symbiosis.<br/><br/>\nI feel joy, and sorrow. I feel them as titanic things, because I am larger than my body, my mind is now a cosmos of its own. I know more joy and more anguish than the entire Qugu race could ever experience.<br/><br/>\nSorrow, because we have killed so much (eighteen species this century alone), and joy for the same reason. Joy that we have put down these blights. Scoured them away and left the universe clean, ready to move towards its final shape. We are a wind of progress. Ripping parasites from the material world \u2014 for if they were not parasites, we would be unable to kill them, and they would still exist. <br/><br/>\nAnd what is that final shape? It is a fire without fuel, burning forever, killing death, asking a question that is its own answer, entirely itself. That is what we must become.<br/><br/>\nMy worm grows fat and hungry. I feed it with whole worlds. My astronomers tell me they can sense the Deep Itself, and that we are conquering our way towards it.<br/><br/>\nI think joy and sorrow will be the same thing soon. Like love and death.",
