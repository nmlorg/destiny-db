    "cardDescription": "Lord Silimar died for his pile of stones.<br/><br/>\nHe died when the Fallen took it in the battle of Alms. He died when the warlords destroyed it in their third great barrage. He died, blade through his eye, when the House of Devils smashed it in their westward campaign. <br/>\nHe died on the structure\u2019s great steps, cut down by an advancing line of Archons, and when the stonework fell to cluster bombs. <br/><br/>\nHe died in the structure\u2019s sprawling shadow and upon its vaunted heights. <br/><br/>\nOnce, during a Fallen siege, while the battlements crumbled beneath his feet, he leapt from its parapet, so that he might know the structure more fully, might feel the weight of the sky pressing down on all that stone and steel. <br/>\n\u201cThe better to raise its next incarnation,\u201d he said to those allies who later questioned his madness. As the Fallen charged, Silimar refused to abandon what he\u2019d built, though others retreated to a stronger position. \u201cGo,\u201d he told them. \u201cSave yourselves. I\u2019ll slow them down.\u201d  <br/><br/>\nThe enemy came in overwhelming force. A breaking wave of blades and firepower and death. Atop the structure\u2019s central bulwark, Lord Silimar held his ground. <br/><br/>\n\u201cTake it if you can, you bastards!\u201d He shouted at the swarming enemy.<br/><br/>\nHe leapt upon the great edifice and there put up a final stand as the enemy engulfed him. He died with his dagger in the guts of an Archon while the great structure shook with explosions and rained stones down upon the land.  <br/>\nLater that night, when Lord Silimar rose again from the ashes, he found Lord Saladin already there and waiting, standing near the place where he\u2019d made his final stand.  <br/><br/>\n\u201cThis structure is doomed,\u201d Saladin said in the darkness. \u201cYou must know this.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cNot doomed,\u201d Silimar said. \u201cFated, perhaps. Doomed is too strong a word.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cUse whatever word you like, but there\u2019s another word that applies to this place: indefensible. And yet after each defeat, you rebuild.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI seek only to build it more perfectly.\u201d<br/><br/>\nLord Saladin shook his head. \u201cOnly a fool would raise the same structure again and again.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThese stones are like us,\u201d Lord Silimar said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d<br/><br/>\nSilimar rose to his feet. He walked among the smoking ruins. The shattered blocks. He glanced down at the piled corpses of dead enemies. The charred remains of a once-great citadel now reduced to scattered rubble.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThey knock us down, you and me,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut time and again, we rise. Like this place.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cEleven times they\u2019ve destroyed what you\u2019ve built,\u201d Saladin said. \u201cWhy rebuild what will be knocked down?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBecause one time they won\u2019t be able to,\u201d Silimar said. \u201cAnd when that day comes, when this perfect, indefensible structure stays standing, then we\u2019ll know.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know what?\u201d<br/><br/>\nLord Silimar looked at his old friend. Then he turned and strode the broken stones, and looked out over the ruins that spread away into the distance. \u201cThen we\u2019ll know it\u2019s safe to build our city to the sky.\u201d",
