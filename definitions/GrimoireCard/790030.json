    "cardDescription": "&#8212; Eksori\u2019s Ambush &#8212;<br/>\nHis foot pressed hard to the sun-cracked ground. Beneath it the Vandal\u2019s neck gave; a hiss of ether burst free before dissipating.<br/><br/>\nRezyl turned. Three Dregs charged. Their Captain raised his shock blade high, unleashing a battle cry to fuel their courage.<br/><br/>\nFocused fire spit from the muzzle of Rezyl\u2019s full-auto. The Dregs fell.<br/><br/>\nTo the Captain, Rezyl was a trophy that would buy unmatched respect among his Devil brothers.<br/><br/>\nTo Rezyl, the Captain was already an afterthought. As ether leaked from the pirate\u2019s broken body with each blow of Rezyl\u2019s heavy fists, Rezyl\u2019s attention had shifted to the unknown, but inevitable, battles to follow.<br/><br/>\nThis was the state of things; conflict as common as breath.<br/><br/>\n&#8212; The Tescan Valley Encounter &#8212;<br/><br/>\nA Ketch with unfamiliar markings hung low between two peaks. A rare sight. Fallen flagships weren\u2019t known to linger so close to the surface, preferring constant motion, like sharks on the hunt.<br/><br/>\nSkiffs circled below the Ketch as their crews prepared to plunder any treasures the facility held.<br/><br/>\nRezyl leveled his rocket launcher. A digital ping signaled a lock, and a trail of smoke shot toward the lead Skiff.<br/><br/>\nTwo more rockets followed in rapid succession.<br/><br/>\nThe lead Skiff took two hits, lurched and retreated back toward the Ketch above.<br/><br/>\nThe third rocket caught a trailing Skiff as the craft turned to engage its attackers.<br/><br/>\nRezyl looked back. \u201cGo.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take a Ketch alone,\u201d Hassa laughed.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe ship isn\u2019t my target,\u201d Rezyl had a plan. Hassa hated Rezyl\u2019s plans with equal parts envy and concern.<br/><br/>\n\u201cLead the Skiffs away,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet\u2014 \u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cCan\u2019t meet if you\u2019re dead,\u201d Tover shot back.<br/><br/>\nRezyl smiled beneath his helm, \u201cGo.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHassa and Tover throttled their Sparrows and disappeared into the heavy woods. Rezyl watched from cover as the Skiffs gave chase.<br/><br/>\nThe Fallen below had taken defensive positions. The rocket attack caught them off guard but they were ready now, and there were more of them than he had time to count.<br/><br/>\nRezyl raced down the slope, weaving between the thick growth of brush and pine, on a direct path for the Fallen clustered at the mountain\u2019s base, his Ghost at his side.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI need you to hang back.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cUhhh...\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cTrust me.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAlways have.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHow quick can you light my spark?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou expect to die? Can\u2019t say that\u2019s the best\u2014 \u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHow quick?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cQuick.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBe ready.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cFor?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost slowed as the Guardian hit the valley floor. <br/><br/>\nThe Fallen opened fire.<br/><br/>\nRezyl leapt from his Sparrow as it transmatted away, his rifle spraying lead at the entrenched pirates.<br/><br/>\nThe Fallen\u2019s Arc bolts peppered Rezyl. Eager Dregs rushed and were met with death as Rezyl marched forward.<br/><br/>\nA massive blast cratered the ground a few feet from the Titan. The Ketch had turned its guns on Rezyl.<br/><br/>\nAnother blast impacted to Rezyl\u2019s left and he stumbled. A third exploded directly in his path...<br/><br/>\n...and Rezyl fell.<br/><br/>\nFrom the treeline, his Ghost watched as the Fallen celebrated and a Skiff drifted down from the Ketch above.<br/><br/>\nThe circle around Rezyl\u2019s body parted and the imposing figure of their Kell stepped forward to admire his prize.<br/><br/>\nThe chittering excitement quieted to a steady drone as the Kell lifted Rezyl\u2019s limp body by the neck.<br/><br/>\nA chorus rose among the crew, growing louder as the Kell hefted Rezyl over his head for all to see.<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost darted low through the crowd. He didn\u2019t like Rezyl\u2019s plan, but now he understood it.<br/><br/>\nDistracted by their Kell\u2019s triumph, the Ghost\u2019s presence went unnoticed until a beam of light swept over Rezyl\u2019s body.<br/><br/>\nThe mood shifted instantly, cheers turning to ravenous shouts.<br/><br/>\nThe Kell\u2019s gaze fell to the Ghost as the beam faded.<br/><br/>\nThe circle began to collapse \u2014 the Fallen set to pounce.<br/><br/>\nAs the Kell moved to toss Rezyl aside, cold steel met the underside of the alien marauder\u2019s jaw, followed by a red flash as Rezyl pulled his cannon\u2019s trigger.<br/><br/>\nEther spewed in an angry geyser and the Kell\u2019s grip loosened. Rezyl hit the ground and unloaded five more rounds into the Fallen leader\u2019s torso. The monster dropped.<br/><br/>\nFrenzied, the Kell\u2019s crew closed in like a flood.<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost lifted above the fray, frantic, \u201cNow! Now! Now!\u201d<br/><br/>\nIn one motion, Rezyl rose from a crouch, his fists clenched and raised high as a storm of Arc Light built within him, his full might raining down on the Kell\u2019s chest. The shockwave of Rezyl\u2019s attack hit like a meteor, shattering <br/>\nthe Kell\u2019s body and any Fallen within the Havoc storm\u2019s radius.<br/><br/>\nThe remaining Fallen staggered, knocked back and dazed.<br/><br/>\nRezyl triggered his Sparrow.<br/><br/>\nHis Ghost flew to his side, \u201cWe leaving?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBefore that Ketch opens up on us.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl punched the throttle as the Fallen crew opened fire.<br/><br/>\n\u201cLet\u2019s never do that again,\u201d his Ghost pleaded.<br/><br/>\nRezyl didn\u2019t have to reply. If war was a constant, \u201cnever\u201d was just an illusion. <br/><br/>\n&#8212; In Defense of North Channel &#8212;<br/><br/>\nWinds from the south caught the smoke and began to clear the thick air.<br/><br/>\nSlowly, the citizens of the small, snow-covered settlement came out from their hiding places.<br/><br/>\nRezyl surveyed their faces \u2014 each weary, but flecked with hope. <br/><br/>\nLiving in the wilds was all they had known. Surviving. Fighting. Hiding. These people had heard stories of a safer place, but tales of a better life were so rarely true.<br/><br/>\nRezyl and his companions had been tracking these Fallen for weeks. Had they caught them sooner this town would have been spared. That any survivors climbed from the rubble to see another day marked this as a victory, but Rezyl <br/>\nwas growing tired of small wins, however meaningful.<br/><br/>\nThat evening, Rezyl and the others led a gathering of survivors on the long journey to the growing city beneath the Traveler. Some settlers remained behind, choosing to stake their claim in the untamed wilds.<br/><br/>\nRezyl admired their resolve, but never looked back. He knew whatever death these brave pioneers avoided that day would come to them... someday... in one form or another.",
