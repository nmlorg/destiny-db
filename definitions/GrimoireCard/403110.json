    "cardDescription": "/ What was that?<br/><br/>\n/ Nothing. We&#39;re secure. <br/><br/>\n/ We&#39;d better be.<br/><br/>\n/ Calm down. Whole district&#39;s been deserted ever since the Gap. Nobody&#39;s here. <br/><br/>\n/ Except us. Why&#39;d he make us come out here?<br/><br/>\n/ Secrecy. I don\u2019t know. He&#39;s our man on the inside; so we humor him. It&#39;s just the quiet making you jump. Help me get this screen set up?<br/><br/>\n/ It feels criminal.<br/><br/>\n/ I got word from the Consensus says it&#39;s not. <br/><br/>\n/ You know what I mean. Maybe it&#39;s not against any law. But it&#39;s messing with the Tower. It feels - <br/><br/>\n/ Dangerous?<br/><br/>\n/ Wrong.<br/><br/>\n/ So go home.<br/><br/>\n/ Yeah, you&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t you? You take the credit, get promoted to Division Head, I&#39;m stuck - <br/><br/>\n/ So stay. OK. Think it&#39;s working now.<br/><br/>\n/ Nothing on screen. Do we have a signal?<br/><br/>\n/ No. Sha - the contact said at 6 sharp.<br/><br/>\n/ Then he&#39;s late. If he dragged us out here for nothing - <br/><br/>\n/ Yeah? What are you going to do to him, exactly?<br/><br/>\n/ Let&#39;s just - <br/><br/>\n/ We have a signal! OK, here it comes.<br/><br/>\n/ Static.<br/><br/>\n/ There -  <br/><br/>\n/ That&#39;s not - <br/><br/>\n/ You&#39;re not Sha - <br/><br/>\n/ 99-40. Arcite. Are you Modris Wyndham and Sya Droysen, of the Tex Mechanica Foundry West District?<br/><br/>\n/ Yes - <br/><br/>\n/ My owner has instructed me to give you the following message: I don&#39;t have time for lowlife dregs like you. You disgust me.<br/><br/>\n/ But - <br/><br/>\n/ My owner has instructed me to continue: Sit down and let the frame talk. I know your type. City bigshots. You can show some damn - <br/><br/>\n/ Listen - <br/><br/>\n/ respect. Now listen. I got your message. The answer is no. I&#39;m - <br/><br/>\n/ But - <br/><br/>\n/ not going to fix Crucible fights for you idiots just to make your Tex Mechanica junk look good. Do you - <br/><br/>\n/ Now I wouldn&#39;t put it quite like that - <br/><br/>\n/ think you&#39;re the first dregs dumb enough to try to buy me? Why do you people think you can buy me? Don&#39;t I have an honest face? Do I look like I need your money? The Crucible is sacred, that&#39;s what you people don&#39;t understand, like you think it&#39;s a game. Now - <br/><br/>\n/ Damn.<br/><br/>\n/ this is the part where you start blustering at my little buddy here and telling him it&#39;s all legal down in the City, just business, just sponsorship. So listen: I can have ten Titans crashing through your ceiling any time I like and you can tell them it&#39;s just business.<br/><br/>\n/ Damn.<br/><br/>\n/ Or we can talk about how you&#39;re going to make this up to me. <br/><br/>\n/ Ah.<br/><br/>\n/ My little buddy&#39;s listening. Make him an offer.",
