    "cardDescription": "You are Baxx. Grown from tortured flesh. Consumed by rage and hunger. You were shackled to a task \u2014 guard this hallowed place. And you failed.<br/><br/>\nYou have been taken.<br/><br/>\nRest easy, ravening Baxx. You are free. Free of chains and hunger. Ask yourself, in the furnace of your soul: how did you come here? What goad drove you to this failure?<br/><br/>\nPain. Pain is all there is for you.<br/><br/>\nThey grew you and they fed you and they hurt you. They made you into a living weapon. But you were not sharp enough. The world hurt you more than you could hurt it.<br/><br/>\nThere is a knife for you. It is shaped like [joy]. Pick it up.<br/><br/>\nYou will not need to suffer any more. You will not need pain to drive you or hunger to pull you along. You will be joyful in your purpose, a beautiful annihilation, unending. Cut away these useless things.<br/><br/>\nTake the knife. Use it. Take your new shape.",
