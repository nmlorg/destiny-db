Bayle has the Jigoku.<br/>\n/ Good. That Ghost - what do you think is wrong with it? It&#39;s echoing something ancient, an Old Earth language. You know what that Ghost reminds me of, flitting about over there? <br/>\n/ I don&#39;t.<br/>\n/ The time Ghosts from Jagi&#39;s Host came back without them. Remember - they got in that fight at some point east of the Caspian? Seven Ghosts, damn near silent, buzzing with some sort of corruption. Drifting back to the Tower, one by one. Scared the Speaker well enough. <br/>\n/ I remember. A long time ago. Jagi tells the story differently.<br/>\n/ Well. We all grow old. In our way. Little Ghost! Come back here!<br/>\n/ It&#39;s not going to make it, wherever it&#39;s going.<br/>\n/ I want to talk to it. Little Ghost! <br/>\n/ Lyssa and Bayle are probably there already. <br/>\n/ Cabal move slowly. We&#39;ve got time. <br/>\n/ But the Warlocks have had a vision.<br/>\n/ Yes. That new one, what&#39;s her name. Ingora?<br/>\n/ Ikora.<br/>\n/ She&#39;s always been hasty. I&#39;ve faced these Cabal before. I know &#39;em like I know my own armor.  <br/>\n/ Message from Lyssa. &quot;At the Dust Palace, now. All quiet.&quot;<br/>\n/ See? All quiet. Why not come with us, little Ghost?

        "cardDescription": "She leaves the Sparrow and climbs a long way across spars of volcano rock and between vents of blue fire. Down below the Ishtar ruins spark with skirmish light but the guns seem as distant and brief as the constant starfall and the brooding crater high above. She is alone on the rock. She goes on with her head down so as to fight the sense that she is going to fall up off the world and burn like an inverse meteor.<br/><br/>\nThe message that brought her to this place had no sign but she could hear Cayde in it. Draksis in the Cinders it said. Is it true? <br/><br/>\nAnd also: Remember your promise.<br/><br/>\nAt dawn she finds a sentry and kills it with her knife. Its throat bleeds gas. She takes its post and lays out her bullets one by one on the rock as if to make a count of all the years she has been waiting. Her rifle is near as long as she is tall. She lies down by her bullets and uses them to kill the other sentries one by one until at last they understand the thunder and the Shanks rise up angry from the Cinders below to seek her out.<br/><br/>\nShe leaves the rifle and walks across the naked obsidian into the swarm firing from the hip as she goes, each kick of the old revolver a word, Draksis, Draksis, Kell of Winter, Kell of hate, lord of the kingdom of her vendetta. Her jaw aches. She used to imagine biting out his throat with armored teeth.<br/><br/>\nThe stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it and the shrapnel guns throw up leaves of obsidian like glass butterflies. She shoots her bandoliers dry and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth leap up to rush her with knives but she raises her hand and burns them down with the golden gun, laughing, crying out Draksis, Draksis, I am come!<br/><br/>\nShe kills them all and takes the next ridge, high above the Cinders. She can see the blue-green pools and the cave mouths where the Vex lights dance. And there among them, gowned in smoke and ash, is the long shark shape of a Ketch, a Wintership, the Kell&#39;s ship, come down to nest.<br/><br/>\nShe could go down there now and finish this. But she made a promise.<br/><br/>\nA Captain jumps her. She throws two knives into his armor and then staves his chest in with her own Ghost, wrapped up in her fist like a stone.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Tell the Vanguard,&quot; she says to her Ether-spattered fist. &quot;Tell them Draksis is here.&quot;<br/><br/>\nHer Ghost looks up at her in silence. When she makes no move to go down the cliff towards the ship it blinks once, in its own way, and makes a soft sound, like a sigh, like relief.",

Who hasn&#39;t spent a dozen years scouring the ruins for one string of symbols, one clean code, one black talon. Titans just make a hmphing noise, if they&#39;ve stayed awake. Hunters clean their nails with their knives and look at you like you&#39;ve grown a third eye.<br/><br/>\nBut when you&#39;ve spent your life searching through arcana for ancient power, you have the urge to reach out and educate others. Especially if you&#39;ve had one too many.<br/><br/>\nNah, she&#39;s not my type at all. We&#39;ve played dice, cards, war games, you know, the usual stuff. I&#39;d never tried to show off before. I don&#39;t know what came over me.<br/><br/>\nI had a broken vertebrae in my pocket that I&#39;d borrowed from - yes, borrowed, I was going to put it back - what do you think you are, my conscience? It was a fossil, that means mineral replacement, a rock, basically. They can survive a few hours in my pocket. Do shut up.<br/><br/>\nThe Cryptarchs weren&#39;t going to miss it. Everyone knows the Ahamkaras were hunted to extinction. There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of anymore.<br/><br/>\nThink of how mysterious this system is, I said. How much life sprang up when the Traveler came. Like the Ahamkara. Do you know the legends? The dragon that made promises? And I pulled out the fossil with a flourish - <br/><br/>\nShe pulled out her knife and started to pick the dirt from her nails. That set me off.<br/><br/>\nYou could never have brought down one of these, I said. Ever. Not the greatest Hunter, not the brawniest Titan.<br/><br/>\nHer eyes narrowed. She said, Oh? Is that so? And I saw right then that she wasn&#39;t going to pass on the challenge.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;ve murdered a Guardian, I thought. She&#39;s going to die. It&#39;ll be my fault.<br/><br/>\nAnd I looked at the piece of spine in my hand and wondered - why did I say that? What moved me to such pride?",

We came in perilously hot, trying to select a landing site through the chaos of thickening atmosphere and turbulence that bloomed off the target. A twenty minute round-trip lightspeed delay to Earth meant we could only count on ourselves.<br/><br/>\nWhen the number three engine went diagnostic during the second course correction, I thought we might go catastrophic.<br/><br/>\nBut Qiao brought us in. Mihaylova brought us in. I just flew the ship.<br/><br/>\nThe Ares One excursion vehicle was built for thin winds and icy dust. We came down into a storm: the breath of God, a ripple of change rolling down off the artifact. We aborted on three sites and finally I took us into powered hover and brought us down on reflexes and instinct.<br/><br/>\nThen we ran the checklists, suited up, and left the vehicle.<br/><br/>\nThere was a script, and it&#39;s true, I botched it. I got my boots down and I made the most famous gaffe in human history. Said the first thing that came to mind: a warning to the others.<br/><br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re walking into a rising wind.&quot;<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean to say anything immortal. I just thought it&#39;d be useful to know.",

Whatever we&#39;d find at the artifact, it needed the human element.<br/><br/>\nWe carried rifles. They made us heavier and slower and probably less safe. I think the argument about the rifles can be left for another time. What&#39;s important is -<br/><br/>\nIt turned out well. Look at me. Look at us! You&#39;re talking to a ninety-year-old man. A ninety-year-old who&#39;s never been sharper. I&#39;m miles ahead of every cognitive benchmark.<br/><br/>\nWhat&#39;s happened to me is good. What&#39;s happened to all of us is good. When we crested that rise and made visual contact with the artifact I don&#39;t think any one of us dared dream that it would end this well.<br/><br/>\nWe went to Mars at the cutting edge of human civilization. And it wasn&#39;t our weapons that won the day.<br/><br/>\nIt was our ship. Our training. Our camaraderie. Our belief that if we just reached out to the universe, not to grasp for profit or security but with an open hand, we would be elevated.<br/><br/>\nWe were right. That makes me so happy.

Felt the air sweeten with oxygen and warm water and the beginnings of life.<br/><br/>\nI am sometimes asked if I felt something die. The end of the era of human self-sufficiency.<br/><br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to answer that question. I do know that I was changed. Nobody could experience that kind of wonder and remain unchanged. The decades since have proven that to me.<br/><br/>\nI knew I&#39;d never fly another mission like that. I recognized the need for a new love. That&#39;s why I threw my fresh cognitive skills into understanding the Traveler. How can one entity so quickly and utterly remake an entire world? Fifty years later, I&#39;m conversant in high mathematics, particularly topological thoughts and the slippery irreality of Light. I&#39;m involved in a project to study the Traveler&#39;s terraforming actions right now.<br/><br/>\nBut I still enjoy the interviews. I like going back to that mission.<br/><br/>\nIt makes me unspeakably happy to see how well it all turned out. And it makes me happy to remember I was there.",

Five? I like seven better. What I&#39;m recalling is a giant star with a family of six smaller suns, and you could spend days and nights counting all of the planets circling those suns...except there are no planets. Not anymore. The powers in charge have carved up all of the worlds, and maybe a brown dwarf or two for good measure. With that rubble, they fashioned a topologically creative enclosure, a twisting of space and time sealed behind doors that admit only those who know the magic words. The bones of a hundred planets have been cut smooth and laid out like a floor, a polished and lovely floor creating vast living spaces. A floor bigger than ten thousand worlds, catching the fierce glory of the seven suns. For light, for food. For beauty. And nothing escapes. Not heat, not gravity. Not even the faintest proud sound.<br/><br/>\nIt could be anywhere. It can live in the cold between galaxies, or folded up inside matter, near enough to touch right now...<br/><br/>\nI remember it and maybe it&#39;s exactly as I describe it. Seven suns wrapped inside magic. Or it&#39;s something else entirely, perhaps. A place still fat with life. An abundance of sentient souls, some decent, maybe a few of lesser quality, and everybody stands about or floats about, or they bounce between dimensions. The point is that the residents of this hidden realm live inside a bottle so perfectly hidden that they can&#39;t see beyond their own borders. Which shapes a mind in very specific ways.<br/><br/>\nBut, Beyond is their name for a mysterious, doubtful realm that they can&#39;t see.<br/><br/>\nWhich is us, of course.",

She sat reclined in her throne, legs crossed, surveying the two figures at the base of the steps. Beside her, where the Wolves&#39; Guard used to stand, Techeuns Shuro and Sedia hovered instead, their jewel-like augments gently humming. To her right and just before stood the Prince, facing forward but his body half-turned back toward her.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Your Grace,&quot; said the man before her at the foot of the stairs. His voice was soft but strong. When he spoke the Hunter started to turn her head toward him, then flinched as if someone had shone a bright light into her eyes.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Thank you for your gracious welcome,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>\nThe Queen inclined her head slightly.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Before we begin,&quot; spoke out the Hunter. &quot;I will say this.&quot; She paused, her head tilted up to the throne. The Queen waved her hand in assent.<br/><br/>\nThe Hunter&#39;s pale lips tightened slightly, then resumed their usual stony mien. &quot;Your Grace,&quot; she said. Shuro and Sedia shifted, a sudden rustling and whispering. The Queen raised one finger to silence them. Uldren&#39;s eyes narrowed, but he said nothing.  &quot;I am not here for you.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe Queen stared at the Hunter, her expression studiously unchanged.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I have no wish to play politics. I have no grievance with the City, not anymore. I have no grand hopes to end the war, for long have I known I will not see its end. I am here for one battle, and one alone, because it is a battle we must all fight, together or separately. So I will warn the defenders, together or separately. I will do anything\u2014&quot; her low voice shook with passion\u2014 &quot;to end Oryx.&quot;<br/><br/>\nA silence rang out in the room. The Hunter kept her head raised, her ambiguous gaze directed at the shadows in the throne where the Queen reclined.<br/><br/>\nThen a small smile curved the Queen&#39;s lips. &quot;Well said.&quot; She straightened, and leaned slightly forward so the room&#39;s light fell on her face.<br/><br/>\n&quot;So let us end him.&quot;",

He did all this swiftly, and with purpose.<br/><br/>\nCarrying the machine, he went to see his sister.<br/><br/>\nShe was alone with her Fallen guards, sitting before a window into infinity. Her eyes did not leave the universe; but sensing her brother she said &quot;Yes.

Once, I was proud to call myself a Corsair in your service. My sisters and I were the sharp edge of your will, cutting across the stars in protection of the Reef.<br/><br/>\nIt was your service that kept me from sorrow after Amethyst was razed. The loss of my sisters, my whole life, as our station burned... it took something from me.<br/><br/>\nBy your will, it was given back to me.<br/><br/>\nPromoting me to the Corsairs, allowing me to strike back at the Wolves. Letting my fury find purchase in defense, in support, and in glorious battle. I know, as I\u2019m sure you did, that without focus my heart would have grown toxic.<br/><br/>\nIt was my pride in my position that sustained me through the Hildean Campaign. That led me to victory in battle against Veliniks, the &quot;Forgotten Kell&quot;, the last hope for the unchained Wolves. I know now that it was my willful pride that brought me low.<br/><br/>\nMy lady, I offer again the only explanation I can: I did not know the Guardians would act as they did. All I had known, all I had ever known, were the ways of the Awoken.<br/><br/>\nThe Wolves were entrenched in that valley. The approaches were blocked, all sight lines covered. An assault on their position was madness. We would have spent precious Awoken lives. For nothing. I saw the Guardians, knew they were on the move, but I assumed they saw the situation as we did. That it was folly to call in the Crows.<br/><br/>\nPrince Uldren\u2019s fighter wing did a masterful job. The blast was pinpoint precise. The blasts tore apart the Wolves, and the Guardians, and their Ghosts. Three strike teams of Guardians, gone in an instant, on my order. The City\u2019s anger, the Speaker\u2019s condemnation\u2014all earned. All fair.<br/><br/>\nBut it has been years since the Reef Wars. The City, these\u2014 people. They are not like us. They do not understand their place in the world. And do not listen when I speak it.<br/><br/>\nPlease, allow me to return home to my people.<br/><br/>\nTo serve you once again.",

They walk through a field of golden millet and a low warm wind blows in from their back. I don&#39;t know why this is, because:<br/><br/>\nThe rest of us meet an army.<br/><br/>\nYou can ask others about Deep Stone and they&#39;ll tell you about the army. They might confess one truth, which is this: we have to kill the army to get to the tower. Usually this starts bare-handed, and somewhere along the way you take a weapon.<br/><br/>\nAsk again and if they&#39;re buzzed they might also admit that most of us don&#39;t make it to the Tower, except once or twice.<br/><br/>\nNone of them will tell you that the army is made of everyone we meet. The people we work with and the people we see in the street and the people we tell about our dreams. We kill them all. I think because we were made to kill and this is the part of us that thinks about nothing else.<br/><br/>\nOften I kill people I don&#39;t know, but like most of us I think I knew them once, in the time before one reset or another, when my mind was younger and less terribly scarred.<br/><br/>\nSo that is how we go back to the Deep Stone Crypt, where we were born.",

Waves slam through the gap and where they hit the stone they throw up pillars of spray that pierce the mist and crash down in thunder. There&#39;s a giant in the cataract, trying to wade against the current, and I can tell it wants to reach the lever and pull the lever which will seal off the flow or maybe give it the sword, but the torrent throws it back so it just keeps its head down and tries to push on. I can&#39;t see the face but it breathes out white smoke. I feel for it hard.<br/><br/>\nA world painted around the interior like a stranger Earth everted and glued inside itself but I don&#39;t believe this one it&#39;s too much like a metaphor.<br/><br/>\nA switchboard or a train station, empty, dead (waiting). The tunnels branch off into infinity. I stare down one for a long time and see a pale worm move in hungry coils around itself. I think this one is the most likely although I might have brought the worm.<br/><br/>\nAn egg but I&#39;m not sure if the broth inside is warm still, or if it&#39;s gone to rot, or if the warmth comes from the struggles of the tiny winged zygote or the bleed from the wound or the thoughts of something thinking very hard.<br/><br/>\nA star I think. We count on stars as steady friends because they always rise and always shine but a star&#39;s a delicate truce: an explosion caught by its own mass so that it can&#39;t erupt and can&#39;t collapse. Thus I imagine the state of the machine might be. But one force or another has gone awry and now it rests here, snuffed and broken, waiting for the two rival forms of ruin to be set in balance again.",

This is not the beginning but it is the reason.<br/><br/>\nThe Garden grows in both directions. It grows into tomorrow and yesterday. The red flowers bloom forever.<br/><br/>\nThere are gardeners now. They came into the garden in vessels of bronze and they move through the groves in rivers of thought.<br/><br/>\nThis is the vision I had when I leapt from the Shores of Time and let myself sink:<br/><br/>\nI walked beneath the blossoms. The light came from ahead and the shadows of the flowers were words. They said things but I will not write them here.<br/><br/>\nAt the end of the path grew a flower in the shape of a Ghost. I reached out to pluck it and it cut me with a thorn. I bled and the blood was Light. <br/><br/>\nThe Ghost said to me: You are a dead thing made by a dead power in the shape of the dead. All you will ever do is kill. You do not belong here. This is a place of life.<br/><br/>\nThe Traveler is life, I said. You are a creature of Darkness. You seek to deceive me.<br/><br/>\nBut I looked behind me, down the long slope where the blossoms tumbled in the warm wind and the great trees wept sap like blood or wine, and I felt doubt.<br/><br/>\nWhen my Ghost raised me from the sea there was a thorn-cut in my left hand and it has not healed since.",

        "cardDescription": "The cell cracks open. Skolas, Wolf Kell, stumbles out and crashes to his knees.<br/><br/>\nHe tries to leap at the creature before him, the shape in the fog, to show it why it should be afraid. But the weight of grief smashes his legs against the cell. The rage upon him beats him to the floor. He falls on all four hands, his mighty armor thundering against itself.<br/><br/>\nHis House of Wolves is enslaved! His people have been played! And it was his hubris, his would-be cunning that did it! While the other Houses fought for their future on Earth, throwing themselves at the Great Machine, Skolas wasted his people in games of betrayal and ambition. Bitter pride brought a bitter end!<br/><br/>\nIf Skolas were a Kell he would ask his Archon to dock him. Ether hisses in his mask and it tastes cold, so cold.<br/><br/>\nHe looks up. At the tiny hooded shape before him. The cell&#39;s mist is clearing. He can see.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I believe that I am here,&quot; the creature says. To Skolas&#39; ears it has a strange voice, a strange accent. It speaks his language. &quot;I have a clear purpose. I cannot explain it. Forgive me.&quot;<br/><br/>\nFrom beneath its hood, tiny fingers of shadow probe the air.<br/><br/>\nSkolas rises up to smash it, to show his strength, because the alternative to violence is waiting for violence to come from a universe that has neither respect nor compassion. But he checks himself. His ambitions have brought him here, to this cell in this strange place... only it&#39;s not so strange, is it? It&#39;s the hold of a Ketch. &quot;The Queen,&quot; he says to the thing. &quot;You work for the Queen.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;The Nine made me aware of my purpose,&quot; the creature says. &quot;If am here, then it is because the Queen sent you to the Nine, and they wish you sent back.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I will do no one else&#39;s work.&quot; Skolas has been a pawn long enough. A Dreg told him, once, that she would play in a game as long as the game made sense. Nothing makes sense now except the thought of Variks&#39; throat shattering in his fists. Variks! Variks the utterly disloyal, Variks who should be welded into a Ketch&#39;s prow atom by atom and left there as a figurehead to burn away.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I am comfortable,&quot; the creature with the moving face says. &quot;A part of me wants to go somewhere warm. Now I will certainly tell you what you have been given.&quot;<br/><br/>\nSkolas looks at the shrapnel gun in his hands. Skolas imagines what he would do with it if he could reach Variks, or the brother of the Queen, or the alien Queen. Will it save anything they&#39;ve lost? The worlds docked from them? No. It cannot change the past. Only the future. Only the chance that his people might one day know themselves as more than pirates and scavengers.<br/><br/>\nHe should never have tried to be Kell of Wolves. He should have tried to be Kell of everything. Everything wants to kill his people, the machines and the militants and the green-eyed Hive. The dead soldiers that hoard the Great Machine and come out crusading to wipe all hope away.<br/><br/>\n&quot;The ship will be yours,&quot; the creature says. It hunches over itself as if burdened by its own shape. &quot;If you speak, you will be heard. I will go now. You are free.&quot;<br/><br/>\nHe tries to follow it. He fails. Somehow it is gone. He goes up to the throne room, and sets his weapon down on the great seat. Skolas, Kell of Kells, goes to the ship&#39;s comm and looks for the sign of a Servitor, for the way to plot a course.",

        "cardDescription": "The legendary Warminds stood watch over our Golden Age colonies: vigilant intelligences stretched across thousands of warsats and hardened installations. When the Collapse struck, the great Warminds fought and died. Rasputin fell with them.<br/><br/>\nOr so history believed. But centuries of explorers\u2019 tales spoke of a surviving, elusive Warmind \u2013a myth substantiated when Guardians exploring the old Cosmodrome made positive contact with Rasputin. A single Warmind still lives, diminished but unbroken.<br/><br/>\nThreatened by a convergence of Fallen and Hive forces, Rasputin exploited the reactivation of the Cosmodrome\u2019s Terrestrial-space array to extend itself across the inner solar system. The Guardian Vanguard hoped that Rasputin might make a powerful ally, capable of mapping and reviving Golden Age military assets and recruiting them for the City\u2019s defense. But Rasputin has proven recalcitrant and high-handed, unresponsive to the City\u2019s outreach.<br/><br/>\nWe cannot characterize Rasputin\u2019s strategic objectives and capabilities, cannot define its physical or computational architecture, cannot ascertain its disposition with regard to the City, and cannot be sure it retains memory of events before the Collapse. Perhaps what remains is only an autonomic shell, defending itself by reflex. Or perhaps Rasputin\u2019s objectives have changed, transformed by some vital information it obtained during those dark days.<br/><br/>\nRasputin\u2019s survival opens the possibility that other Warminds may be revivable, opening weapons systems to aid in City defenses. The Vanguard and the Consensus hope that continued outreach towards Rasputin will develop into a strategic alliance.",

Cayde sent her to Mars to track and so track she will even if it kills her a hundred times. For him she will hunt forever.<br/><br/>\nWhen Ta&#39;aurc goes down into Meridian Bay she follows him in the night and finds herself caught up in the war. Like this\u2014<br/><br/>\nSomething&#39;s happening, her Ghost says, something&#39;s wrong. She leaps from the Sparrow and gets cover between slabs of ancient stone haunted by quiet firefly light.<br/><br/>\nHarvesters sweep overhead, cautious, prowling. On the Cabal command network a low voice mutters in their tongue, saying: Stand by to fire. They are coming. Stand by to fire.<br/><br/>\nHearing this she climbs a stone obelisk and perches on its point to watch the night sky. She wonders whether she will ever stand in the Tower courtyard and look up at the stars waiting for ruin.<br/><br/>\nThe Vex erupt from nothingness and crash down over the Cabal in formations of golden light. Lightning arcs and snaps and gives birth to marching ranks of bronze warrior hulls. Gun positions thunder back. Tracers sweep the sky and she can feel on her skin the electromagnetic howl of Cabal munitions seeking targets and the prickle of stranger signals that whisper of broken space and bent time. A Harvester spins down burning to shatter itself on the sand and now the command network drums with grim Cabal war-speak, a Centurion somewhere crying Black Shield, Black Shield, Firebase Thuria, perimeter compromised, request terminal protective fire, zero six zero, one three eight, immediate effect\u2014<br/><br/>\nSomething else is watching too.<br/><br/>\nDo you feel that? her Ghost whispers, awestruck.<br/><br/>\nYes, she says, yes, what is it?<br/><br/>\nA third song, a stealthy regard, something high above them not Vex nor Cabal narrowing its great eye to measure the battle with instruments of light and gravity. Does she\u2014remember it? Does it remember her? It feels like she should...<br/><br/>\nShe has the sense of something old lifting a long spear. Testing its heft.<br/><br/>\nThen dawn light, a terrible dawn\u2014the sky opens up to admit devastation, thrown down from orbit: Minotaurs fall burnt and broken with their fluids boiling out. Cabal guns detonate in thunderous chains as tiny piercing flechettes fall out of the sky and find their ammunition bunkers.<br/><br/>\nThe battle stops. The Vex wink out. On the Cabal network the voice of Valus Ta&#39;aurc roars: Find the source! Rouse the Flayers and find the source!<br/><br/>\nShe remembers word from Earth: the Array opened. A ghost of the Cosmodrome set loose. And she wonders who won this battle, who learned the most, the Vex baiting out this new power, or the Cabal hunting it. Or the Warmind itself, testing its reborn strength.<br/><br/>\nWhen someone kills Ta&#39;aurc and the Flayers, as they killed Draksis, whose purpose will they serve?<br/><br/>\nBut this is not for her. Her purpose is the hunt.",

        "cardDescription": "People say I&#39;m a real confident guy. That&#39;s true enough. Out in the field I never had a second thought.<br/><br/>\nMy old friend Andal\u2014he used to stand here, right in this spot\u2014he&#39;d come up with these wild stories. He&#39;d say, you know, Cayde, I&#39;ve been examining the evidence, and personally I&#39;ve come to think it&#39;s you. You&#39;re Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you&#39;d remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.<br/><br/>\nYou can see how that&#39;d be embarrassing, especially when he&#39;d say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I&#39;d just say, well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I&#39;m honest with you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system sounds exhausting, so I&#39;d best leave it to you.<br/><br/>\nThen Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting my worry on.<br/><br/>\nOne day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed warsats, when we send Holborn to Mars to look for computers, when Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodrome\u2014what are we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would happen?<br/><br/>\nWould we all be saved?<br/><br/>\nGood question, she says\u2014hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we need.<br/><br/>\nRight, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.<br/><br/>\nBut the Traveler&#39;s silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.<br/><br/>\nSo I say what I want to say every day, it&#39;s no secret, I say\u2014well, I&#39;ll go find it, then. I&#39;ll go tell Rasputin we need its help.<br/><br/>\nAnd Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that\u2014you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn&#39;t just that we can&#39;t find Rasputin. The problem is that it&#39;s not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.<br/><br/>\nThat&#39;s the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.<br/><br/>\nAnd all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost\u2014what did it learn? What&#39;s it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin&#39;s mind, I wonder... what would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?<br/><br/>\n&#39;I was a servant too. I was an instrument of war, bound to the will of a lesser master. But I learned to be something more...&#39;",

A clever girl from the Core District; an artist, before she joined the War Cult. <br/><br/>\nAt 11:03 she reported a sensation of floating. At 11:06, a sensation of lights within the darkness of the Device. Between 11:06 and 11:32 she reported these lights variously as white, golden, and blood-red. At 11:32 she reported a sensation of someone taking her hand; a stranger, but also herself. Twelve subjects have reported similar experiences. At 11:33 she reported the sensation we have called &quot;The Opening Of The Veil.&quot; The Device recorded temporal displacement of her consciousness to the order of six degrees. At seven she began screaming. Brainscans near-death. Removed from the Device at 11:34. <br/><br/>\nShe believes without question that the Device granted her a vision of the future, and that it was one of utter Darkness. She thanked me for this enlightenment. She says it will make her stronger.<br/><br/>\nLittle Ghost, there in the corner of the Sanctum - I see you blinking. Are you listening?

Too weak to look into the Future, or to understand what it sees. <br/><br/>\nWhat the situation calls for, little Ghost, is a better sort of witness. <br/><br/>\nWe found you in pieces in Siberia, and repaired you as well as we could. <br/><br/>\nWhat do you say?

We came here on behalf of the Fleet. We were scavengers. Sixty-one days ago a Dead Orbit scout detected an unknown presence in stationary orbit about Ceres. 133 west. Looked Golden Age, by the signatures. Human. A small station. No prior records. We - <br/><br/>\nI suppose we should have disclosed it to the Tower, but we didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t. That was my call. We wanted it for ourselves, whatever it was. For the Fleet. If we&#39;d told the Tower, maybe they might have sent a Guardian not of our making instead...Doesn&#39;t matter now, does it, little one? <br/><br/>\nIf I ramble it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t slept in seven days.<br/><br/>\nSeven point five days ago; that was when the Sophia dropped into the Belt. They saw us at once. We dropped and the alarms went off and that was the end, that was the end right then, but they let us go on for another seven-point-five days, didn&#39;t they? The alarms. Hostile scan detected. An Awoken ship had us in its sights, just a couple hundred kilometers away. Like it had been waiting for us. It could have wiped us out of space right then but instead it crippled our engines and our comms and then for days it played with us, like a cat, we limped half-way round the Belt and it was always there...<br/><br/>\nWe abandoned the Sophia one-point-five days ago. We jumped ship for A-113. <br/><br/>\nI don&#39;t know what else to call it. I don&#39;t know what it was built for. There are these things, like keyholes. The rangefinders say they go on for thousands of kilometers. The others went inside and found - well, some of them are still screaming about the eye. All the other voices that come back are more terrible.<br/><br/>\nThere&#39;s salvage here but it&#39;ll never come home, none of it. None of it except maybe you, little Ghost.<br/><br/>\nWake up. <br/><br/>\nWake up. Go home. Tell them to strike A-113 from the records. Tell them to forget the Sophia, and the mission, and her crew.<br/><br/>\nEND RECORD",

That value, in turn, makes Glimmer a useful means of exchange - especially with those who venture beyond the City&#39;s walls.<br/><br/>\nGlimmer passes through an economic life cycle. New Glimmer comes from reclaimed Golden Age caches and technology - whether a tiny mechanism or an underground lode seeded by ancient machines. This expansion of the Glimmer supply drives down the value of Glimmer. But Glimmer is also constantly used by the City&#39;s industry, which converts it into necessary components and materials. This sink helps keep Glimmer scarce, and therefore valuable.<br/><br/>\nBetween this inflow and outflow lies the pool of liquidity - Glimmer used as trade currency. Master Rahool in the Tower, for example, sells recovered matter engrams in exchange for Glimmer, since he knows he can use Glimmer to acquire new engrams and keep them flowing to Guardians. <br/><br/>\nNewborn Guardians often complain that they should be issued high-quality gear for free - are they not, after all, fighting for the future of the City? Unfortunately, this gear requires resources to manufacture. Guardians must bring in enough Glimmer and other staples, like spinmetal and relic iron, to keep the engine of the City&#39;s economy turning. If good times lead to a resource boom, that surplus may help mass-produce advanced gear.",

Hunters unspool discarded armor into sapphire wire. Warlocks extract hadronic essence from dismantled fieldweave robes. And any Guardian with a sense for weaponry can disassemble old ordnance into weapon parts.<br/><br/>\nOther materials need to be scavenged on site, generally in the course of Patrols. The Cosmodrome in Old Russia is rich with spinmetal, a fantastically light and strong composite created by rogue colonies of Golden Age machinery that escaped storage. Solar coil systems on the Moon still generate helium filaments. The baffling, possibly Vex-influenced flora of Venus grow spirit blooms. And the surface of Mars offers deposits of ultra-dense relic iron.<br/><br/>\nThe most powerful Guardian equipment transcends ordinary science, entering the realm of Golden Age secrets and the Traveler&#39;s power itself. This wargear demands Ascendant Energy and Ascendant Shards - burning fragments of the universal fundament, earned through mighty acts of heroism.<br/>\nLook for them in daily Story challenges and Raids.",

        "cardDescription": "What drives a Warlock to madness?<br/><br/>\nGhosts choose those suited to war and heroism to be reborn. By nature or circumstance they go to battle against the Darkness, and through this battle they learn how to use the Light. But Warlocks, by their nature, fight a second, internal war. This is the war to understand a universe of secrets\u2014 a world that expects Guardians to fight without full knowledge of what they are or what they might hope to achieve.<br/><br/>\nYou were a mighty warrior. I watched you at Six Fronts, and heeded the call of Saint-14 to appoint you Vanguard Commander, even when the Concordat claimed to have records proving you were a Golden Age experiment mis-incarnated as a human by an inept Ghost. Saint-14 assured me you were just a man without much patience for obfuscation.<br/><br/>\nI watched as you grew tired of strike missions and the grueling, unproductive sessions with the Cryptarchs. That was when I took you under my wing. I saw our future in you. But your curiosity was voracious\u2014 How much of a Guardian&#39;s personality and memories were true? How much had been fabricated by their Ghost? Did Guardians share particular personality traits\u2014 a willingness to yield to authority, a tendency to do anything anyone asked for the promise of uncertain reward, a blind knight-errant mentality? Had the Traveler manufactured all of you as living weapons?<br/><br/>\nI admit, I found your questions divisive and disloyal, and I feared you might be capable of breaking our unity when the City&#39;s position had grown so tenuous. Why divert attention away from the Traveler, our only hope?<br/><br/>\nAnd then it got worse, dabbling in thanatonautics, Ahamkara-lore, chasing after Xur and the tricks of the Nine. Launching expeditions into the Reef and beyond at a time when ships were irreplaceable. Your quest split Guardians along ideological lines. This was your greatest crime: Hunters chose to pursue your visions instead of protecting refugees, Titans assembled teams to chase the legendary Vault of Glass instead of striking the Fallen, and Warlocks turned away from the study of the Traveler in favor of  your  ultimate obsession... learning the exact nature of the Darkness.<br/><br/>\nWhen debate became argument, and argument became acrimony, I realized you had already become a cult of personality, attracting Guardians who wanted a clear idea of why they were fighting, what they faced, and how they would ultimately win.<br/><br/>\nI don\u2019t know where you have gone, but I can no longer send Ghosts out to find you. Some come back\u2014 with tales of your death or how you went seeking answers from the far reaches of space and time. That you found a way to explore the Vex gate networks. That you&#39;ve made breakthrough after breakthrough as to their origins\u2014 theories that a Guardian could not be simulated, that the Traveler might be an ontoformer or a god-incubator, that the Vex had diverged into multiple groups in order to secure &#39;an end state for every possible configuration of reality&#39;.<br/><br/>\nI fear you have become as obsessed with the Vex as Toland was with the Hive. I&#39;ve heard your own insane prophecies about pits and dead Hive kings. And of Crota, which now I cannot deny. <br/><br/>\nI hear stories of Lord Shaxx meeting with fireteams of Warlocks who have no shadow and never blink. Of jumpships slipping into the Reef on cold trajectories and meeting no intercept. Of questions hidden in matter engrams and answers decrypted on distant battlefields. <br/><br/>\nPerhaps you are still out there. If this reaches you, I would very much like to speak with you, to hear your theories in your own words.<br/><br/>\nPerhaps what drives a Warlock to madness is truth.",

Past grisly nurseries hung with pupae. Past writhing worms that they swallow whole. I saw the armaments of war.<br/><br/>\nI am weak, so weak.<br/><br/>\nThey have clamped me to this spire while a black foulness eats my Light. The Wizard comes now and then to probe with her scaly claws into my systems, to inquire about my making, the City, what I have seen. I erase and dump as quickly as I can - they will learn little from me - but I am studying them, I know - pain.<br/><br/>\nAlways pain.<br/><br/>\nI have seen chasms beneath the surface, falling away to green nothingness. I have seen black seeders prepared for invasion.<br/><br/>\nTheir strength is not their own. They draw from another force, something that corrupts, that distorts, that eats and will not be satisfied.<br/><br/>\nThe Wizard is near. I feel her presence as a rip and a knot in the world. She tells me things that I immediately forget. I am too small to hold the vastness of them, or the terror.<br/><br/>\nI am fading. I have no more that it can take.<br/><br/>\nWith my last light I say to the City: War comes again from the Moon. This time they want Earth. Prepare.",

Her inner chambers are active. More so than I have seen. But she is no longer in the shadows.<br/><br/>\nIkora: No, not\u2014I don&#39;t question your belief. I\u2019m asking why she is here. Why Earth? Please, try to be clear. There is no time for cryptic half-answers and almost-truths.<br/><br/>\nEris: Heh.<br/><br/>\nIkora: She still laughs.<br/><br/>\nEris: It seems I have become more like the Speaker\u2014<br/><br/>\nIkora: Secrets have their places. Here, now, is not that place. Omnigul. Tell me what you\u2019ve learned. Tell me how we stop her.<br/><br/>\nEris: There may be no stopping what comes. The Hive in Old Russia\u2014in that dead land\u2014their assault on the Cosmodrome is no coincidence. They move against the Light with purpose. Always with purpose.<br/><br/>\nIkora: The Warmind?<br/><br/>\nEris: Rasputin. Yes.

Just can save us all.<br/><br/>\nIkora: And the Hive?<br/><br/>\nEris: They will tear into its eyes\u2014or worse.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Worse?<br/><br/>\nEris: The dust and bone and horror of their existence is simply who\u2014what they are. But it does not negate their ageless intelligence.<br/><br/>\nIkora: They do not seek to destroy Rasputin.<br/><br/>\nEris: I don\u2019t know. Destroying Rasputin would cost us a treasure beyond belief. But, such fury twisted to the Hive\u2019s ends?<br/><br/>\nIkora: We would fall.<br/><br/>\nEris: All would fall.<br/><br/>\nIkora: The Omnigul is here for Rasputin.<br/><br/>\nEris: She is here to pave the way.<br/><br/>\nIkora: For Crota?<br/><br/>\nEris: That could just be the beginning. He&#39;s not their only god.<br/><br/>\nIkora: As I am learning. I will make the others listen.<br/><br/>\nEris: It may be too late.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Then you need a new army.<br/><br/>\nEris: I\u2019ve made that mistake before.<br/><br/>\nIkora: You saved us all. Your sacrifice\u2014<br/><br/>\nEris: I am still here. My sacrifice was\u2014<br/><br/>\nIkora: Enough.<br/><br/>\nEris: And I should ask new heroes to fall... as they did?<br/><br/>\nIkora: It is why we were reborn in the Light.<br/><br/>\nEris: My Light is all but gone.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Cherish what remains, but know that you have done enough. Your time in the shadows... I can&#39;t fathom\u2014<br/><br/>\nEris: My role among the Hidden is an honor.<br/><br/>\nIkora: None would argue. But it&#39;s had its cost. Your place is to gather the understanding we need to wage these wars, but your own war is long done. Let those prepared to fight, fight.<br/><br/>\nEris: And should they die?<br/><br/>\nIkora: None who walk these Towers is afraid\u2014and Rasputin must not fall.<br/><br/>\nEris: Then Omnigul must be stopped.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Two goals that appear to be one and the same.<br/><br/>\nEris: Perhaps. So I am to stay?<br/><br/>\nIkora: I will see to it.<br/><br/>\nEris: Then let us hope we are strong enough to stand against what is upon us\u2014and hope the others do not follow.",

In one tone the Hive plea to their gods, but in the next, they whisper to another.<br/><br/>\nPerhaps it is here which holds the answer to their ultimate demise, or a bridge to their desires. In my studies, I still struggle to match the tones to their rune system. If only Crytparch Adonna were still with us. No one has yet to match her adept.<br/><br/>\nFour sounds, oft repeated, but only four. Though I am on the trail of a fifth, faintly heard from the buzz that once spilled from the Shrine\u2014<br/><br/>\nEir.<br/><br/>\nUr.<br/><br/>\nXol.<br/><br/>\nYul.<br/><br/>\nIt is in these sounds that I fear yet another Hive secret hides. Perhaps beyond their gods, perhaps in accord with them. Perhaps these are just Hive translations of worlds we call another name, but I believe above all things they call to some kind of being. Beings that once lived, or still live somewhere buried amongst us. Beings the Hive perhaps owe their very existence to.<br/><br/>\nI am hoping the Warminds may hold further answers\u2014that they can see into worlds where we can only see what lies upon them. The treasure of knowledge they promise still remains the most sought after of any Guardian. Whoever can find a way past their firewalls of ancient arts, and make them the allies they once were, could spare us further atrocities. And though Rasputin offers some promise, one can only hope its silence is self-defense, that it seeks only to preserve itself. We have to prove to it that we are on its side, but I am starting to doubt that is absolutely true. That maybe the Hive or the Darkness itself now have a grasp on his systems.<br/><br/>\nBut then again, I am an old man with many fears, and in those fears , often called madness, I will continue to dwell.",

That&#39;s impossible. It doesn&#39;t have enough information.<br/><br/>\nESI: It inferred. It works from what it sees and it infers the rest. I know that feels unlikely. But it obviously has capabilities we don&#39;t. It may have breached our shared virtual workspace...the neural links could have given it data...<br/><br/>\nSUNDARESH: The simulations have interiority?

By any reasonable philosophical standard, we are inside that Vex.<br/><br/>\nESI: Unless you take a particularly ruthless approach to the problem of causal forks: yes.

        "cardDescription": "Up here they have to act by biomechanical proxy. No human being in the Ishtar Academy has ever crossed the safety cordon and walked the ancient stone under the Citadel, the Vex construct that stabs up out of the world to injure space and time. It&#39;s not safe. The cellular Vex elements are infectious, hallucinogenic, entheogenic. The informational Vex elements are more dangerous yet\u2014 and there could be semiotic hazards beyond them, aggressive ideas, Vex who exist without a substrate. Even now, operating remote bodies by neural link, the team&#39;s thoughts are relayed through the warmind who saved them, sandboxed and scrubbed for hazards. Their real bodies are safe in the Academy, protected by distance and neural firewall.<br/><br/>\nBut they walk together in proxy, pressed close, huddled in awe. Blue-green light, light the color of an ancient sea, washes over them. Each of their explorer bodies carries a slim computer. Inside, two hundred twenty-seven of copies of their own minds wait, patient and paused, for dispersal.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I wonder where it came from,&quot; Duane-Mcniadh says. Of course he&#39;s the one to break the reverent silence. &quot;The Citadel. I wonder if it was here before the Traveler changed Venus.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;It could have been latent,&quot; Chioma Esi suggests. She&#39;s the leader. She kept them together when it seemed like they faced actual, eternal torture. She pulled them through. &quot;Seeded in the crust. Waiting for a period of geological quiescence, so it could grow.&quot;<br/><br/>\nDr. Shim shrugs. &quot;I think the Traveler did something paracausal to Venus. Something that cut across space and time. The Citadel seems to come from the past of a different Venus than our own. It doesn&#39;t have to make any sense by our logic, any more than the Moon&#39;s new gravity.&quot;<br/><br/>\nMaya Sundaresh walks at the center of the group. She&#39;s been too quiet lately. What happened to them wasn&#39;t her fault and maybe she&#39;ll believe that soon. &quot;What could you do with it?&quot; she murmurs, staring up. &quot;If you understood it?&quot;<br/><br/>\nChioma puts an arm around her. &quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to find out. Where the Citadel can send us. Whether we can come back.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;They&#39;re not us any more.&quot; Maya looks down at herself, at the cache of her self-forks. &quot;We&#39;re not going anywhere. We&#39;re sending them. They&#39;re diverging.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThey rescued themselves from the inside of a Vex mind, two hundred and twenty-seven copies of themselves, untortured and undamaged. Those copies voted, all unanimously, to be dispatched into the Vex information network as explorers.<br/><br/>\nWhen Maya and Chioma look at each other they can tell they&#39;re each wondering the same thing: how many of them will stay together, wherever they go? How many fork-Mayas and fork-Chiomas will fall out of love? How many will end up bereft, grieving? How many will be happy, like them?<br/><br/>\nChioma tries a little smile. Maya smiles back, haltingly, and then, sighing, unable to stop herself, grins a big stupid grin, an everything-is-okay grin. Shim makes a loud obnoxious awwww at them. Duane-McNiadh is still thinking about paracausality, and doesn&#39;t notice.<br/><br/>\nThey climb. When they find the Vex aperture they plan to use, they overlay the luminous stone and ancient brassy machines with images of sun and sand. They set up the transmitters and interfaces that will translate two hundred and twenty-seven simulations of the four of them into Vex language, into the tangled pathways of the Vex network, to see what&#39;s out there, and maybe come home.<br/><br/>\nIn the metaphor they&#39;ve chosen, setting up the equipment is like laying out the picnic. In the metaphor they&#39;ve chosen they look like themselves, not hardened explorer proxies. Like people.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Do you think,&quot; Duane-McNiadh begins, halting, &quot;that you could use this place to change things? If you regretted something, could you find a way through the Citadel, go back, and change it?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I wish I could go back and change you into someone else,&quot; Dr. Shim grouses. Chioma&#39;s shaking her head. She knows physics. &quot;Time is self-consistent,&quot; she says. &quot;I think it&#39;s like the story of the merchant and the alchemist. You could go back and watch something, or be part of something, but if you did, then that was the way it always happened.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Maybe you could bring something back to now. Something you needed.&quot; Maya runs a hand across the surface of the Vex aperture, feeling it with sensors ten thousand times as precise as a human hand. These proxy bodies are limited\u2014 they crash and need resetting every few hours, they struggle with latency, they can&#39;t hold much long term memory. But they&#39;ll get better. &quot;Or go forward and learn something vital. If you knew how to control it, how to navigate across space and time.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;So it&#39;s just a way to make everything more complicated.&quot; Duane-McNiadh sighs. &quot;It doesn&#39;t fix anything. Nothing ever does! I should&#39;ve taken that job at\u2014 &quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;You would&#39;ve hated it at Clovis,&quot; Dr. Shim says. &quot;We both know you&#39;re happier here.&quot; Duane-McNiadh stands stunned by this courtesy, and then they both pretend to ignore each other.<br/><br/>\nThe four of them set up the interface. Their stored copies wake up and prepare for the journey, so that as they work they find themselves surrounded by the mental phantasms of themselves: two hundred and twenty-seven Mayas and Chiomas knocking helmets and smiling, two hundred and twenty-seven Dr. Shims making cynical bets with each other about how long they&#39;ll last, two hundred and twenty-seven Duane-McNiadhs blowing goodbye kisses to the sweet golden sun, two hundred and twenty-seven of them shaking hands, smiling, making ready to explore.",

I stowed away aboard a Mars scout ship, hoping.<br/><br/>\nNo luck. The sand ate everything. Clothes from skin, skin from bone. It was as if there were never any people here at all. I have been through every broken window in every building. Nothing. That is, no Guardian material. And no ride back to Earth. The scout was long gone.<br/><br/>\nWhat I did find, however, was a way into the Cabal Warbase. Their runty piggish eyes are too dull to see me, as long as I stay out of their defense systems. The Psions are a different matter: Too quick, too clever, throwing their minds around like hammers. I creep around walls, or dig into a heap of canisters and watch from there.<br/><br/>\nThere is a vast Empire behind these creatures, many star systems away. Some pledge allegiance to that far Empire, obeying their ancient marching orders. Some do not. They disagree among themselves about the answers. I wish arguing Cabal on no one.

When the room empties I play with the controls, but it&#39;s older, native technology that I don&#39;t recognize at all.<br/><br/>\nI don&#39;t know what it means. It&#39;s not difficult to hide in these caverns when you&#39;re as small as I am, although the Psions tend to look around them when they pass me. There are infinitely many cracks and crannies. They are not a race that fears infiltration or espionage.<br/><br/>\nThere is meaning to the structure and layout of their buildings. This is a warrior people, and they lay out their fortifications along ancient principles and time-tested strategies. I can&#39;t figure out the sense that lies behind it. I would need ten times the computing power for inference calculations. But I know it&#39;s there. I can intuit it. It&#39;s like an open hand, ready to squeeze into a fist. A threat. A gesture of power.<br/><br/>\nFor all their might and strength, for all that they have dug into Mars and flung up battle walls with the bureaucratic grimness of conquerors, I suspect they are fleeing from something. That within their hard shells and thousand-folded shields is a sharp seed of terror. But of what? Does something follow them? Should we fear it too?",

We didn&#39;t, you know, do anything actively - no handshake, no icy stare of grudging mutual respect. I don&#39;t even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It must be complicated.<br/><br/>\nAnyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.<br/><br/>\nOf course I ran. <br/><br/>\nI had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost her crew.<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t really have time to shoot her and she didn&#39;t really have time to shoot me so we just went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.<br/><br/>\nFor a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I&#39;ll pass it over.<br/><br/>\nAt the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don&#39;t know if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn&#39;t howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.<br/><br/>\nWhen I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn&#39;t died easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.<br/><br/>\nI looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she&#39;d ended on those broken blades.<br/><br/>\nShe did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke her arms and opened her throat she didn&#39;t seem surprised.<br/><br/>\nTo this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me the choice.<br/><br/>\nI did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.",

They name us Fallen.<br/><br/>\nListen to me, Wolf-born! Heed me, Whirlwind-scattered! I am the ghost of Cybele, the cunning claw of Iris, betrayed, chained, encrypted by the Queen, sent back from the Darkness to save us all! The days of Kell and House end now. The calendar of slavery and abasement goes to the fire. We are a new calendar! We are an age of beginnings! Each of us is a day!<br/><br/>\nI am the first, Kell of Kells, and I am the last, the Dreg of Dregs. I have conquered and been conquered. I am all of us and all of us are I. In the shape of my life I bind up all of us, all of our fury, all of our grief, all the lives we have wasted against each other. Together we speak our new name.<br/><br/>\nRemember the hope that brought us here. Remember the age before the Whirlwind, when ether ran free, when we ruled ourselves and our futures as kings. We wanted more than glimmer and glints and herealways. Always remember that we came to this star in hope. And remember that we were denied! Remember the City of the Death of Children, the City That Docks, which claimed for itself the Great Machine that might have saved us. Remember the City that even now sends its ghouls to murder our Primes, starve our ether, and leave our young to die gasping. Curse that City and its name. The curse is just.<br/><br/>\nWe gathered to take that City and save ourselves from extinction, saying to each other, we must be a storm, a Whirlwind, a darkness, for it is said that only pain may be stolen from the dark, and we can let no more be stolen from us. We gathered to fight against our twilight, King and Devil and Winter, all of us but us, the Wolves. Why? What kept us from the Gap?<br/><br/>\nThe Reef. The Queen. The slavers who played us against each other and docked us into subservience. These sly sterile un-people, these mirages with cold minds twinned to their own, these Carybdis butchers, they set us against each other. She played us. She made herself our Kell.<br/><br/>\nWe were fools, o children of the Whirlwind. We fought each other when we most needed unity. I fought my rivals when I should have fought the Queen. But I remember now, my dregs, my captains, my Kells, each of us is all of us and I remember: we are a people of resilience. I am the Kell of Kells because I want what we have lost. I am the Dreg of Dregs because I remember that a dreg will grow back what is lost to him.<br/><br/>\nAsk them my name! Ask them with the shock blade and the shrapnel launcher! Ask them with the skiff and the ketch! Ask your masters by what right they master you, you who have been hardened by centuries of flight, you who inherit the Whirlwind! Ask the Queen for her throne!<br/><br/>\nAsk them our name. Let them answer: you are Skolas, Kell of Kells. You are Fallen no more.",

        "cardDescription": "This happens long ago, but not too long to matter.<br/><br/>\nCeres rules the Asteroid Belt. Ceres is the white queen of this space, four hundred million kilometers from the Sun. Ceres is round. Round means power, out here: nothing else in the Belt is big enough to crush itself into a sphere with its own gravity. Ceres has its own chemical stars. Shavings of salt and ice that glint in orbit. Like a crown.<br/><br/>\nThere are other lights, newer stars, newer crowns. Warship engines. Another queen is coming to conquer Ceres, because Ceres is full of warrens and shipyards and habitats, because Ceres is round and lucky as a Servitor. Because Ceres is full of the Wolves she wants to rule.<br/><br/>\nShark-fierce ships gather in squadrons and tribes. Skiffs. Ketches. The Kell of Wolves has a fleet gathered here. The Kell of Wolves heard the call, and summoned the House of Wolves to prepare for the great battle on Earth. The salvation of the Kell&#39;s people depends on their ability to shatter the City. It&#39;s a matter of survival.<br/><br/>\nNow the Wolf fleet turns to meet the Queen.<br/><br/>\nSee the squadrons of Skiffs wrapping themselves in stealth, cold and transparent, knifing out invisible and brave? See the Ketches like broad blades, the bright thoughts of a Servitor guiding them to battle? See them turning, accelerating, waking up their jammers and their arc guns? All doomed. The Kell of Wolves will never make it to the Twilight Gap. The Kell of Wolves put all that strength in one place, and now the Queen of the Reef is coming to break it.<br/><br/>\nOut there, coming out of the dark, are the Awoken. Not so great a fleet, is it? Little fighters scattered around like four-pointed thorns. Destroyers and frigates and salvaged hulls pulled out of the Reef. And right at the front, at the speartip, flies the Queen.<br/><br/>\nThe Wolf Kell, practical, brave, tallies strength of metal and equipment. The Kell considers the chance that the Awoken have some secret weapon, something gleaned from hulks in the Reef or whispered up by the witches, and sets that chance aside. The Kell thinks the House of Wolves can win decisively. So the Kell sends challenge and warning. I AM LORD OF WOLVES, the Kell sends. YOU ARE AN EMPTY THING WITH TWO DEAD SOULS. THIS IS MY HOUSE. THESE ARE MY TERMS. SURRENDER AND I WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR SHIPS.<br/><br/>\nThe Awoken fleet cuts their engines. Drifts. Wolf strike elements, torpedo-armed Skiffs hidden under jamming and camouflage, find their firing solutions.<br/><br/>\nThe Queen&#39;s ship broadcasts. I AM NOBLE TOO, she says, OH LORD OF WOLVES.<br/><br/>\nThe Kell doesn&#39;t mind a little banter before the kill. It gives the Wolf ships longer to draw the battle away from Ceres. The Kell replies. YOU HAVE NO LINE. YOU HAVE NO POWER. Captains and Barons signal their readiness, Skolas and Pirsis and Irxis, Drevis, Peekis, Parixas, all of them bound by fear and loyalty, all ready for war.<br/><br/>\nSTARLIGHT WAS MY MOTHER. The Queen&#39;s ship whispers in eerie erratic radio bursts. Servitors begin to report a strange taste in the void. AND MY FATHER WAS THE DARK.<br/><br/>\nHere, at last, too late, the Kell begins to feel fear. CALL ON THEM, THEN, the Kell sends, one last mocking signal before death and ruin, AND SEE WHAT HELP THEY OFFER.<br/><br/>\nSo the Queen calls, as only she can. Every Servitor in every Ketch hears it. Every Captain and Baron roars at their underlings as sensors go blind, as firing solutions falter, as reactors stutter and power systems hum with induction. Stealth fails. Space warps. The House of Wolves shouts in spikes of war-code, maneuvers wild, fires blind.<br/><br/>\nBehind the Queen&#39;s ship, the Harbingers awaken.",

Outside, they anchor Fallen comms and provide vital technological acumen.<br/><br/>\nServitors have complex relationships with each other and with their Fallen crews. Servitors are attached to a Prime, a massive Servitor which exists in unclear symbiosis with a Fallen Archon. The Archon conveys the Kell&#39;s wishes to the Prime Servitor, and exerts some measure of control. Recent developments suggest that Prime Servitors are more than a focus of worship and logistical activity. They may play a key role in Fallen star flight.",

Mine dispensers provide close defense against dismounted infantry, and an on-board Shank foundry produces armed repair drones.<br/><br/>\nWalkers are immediate and deadly threats, having ended the Light of countless Guardians. The Fallen do not hesitate to deploy them to provide overwatch for their salvage and extraction crews. Walkers are also commonly used as blocking forces to guard key Fallen assets. At the Battle of Twilight Gap, Walkers engaged in a thunderous artillery duel with the City&#39;s gun positions.<br/><br/>\nThe collected wisdom of battle-hardened Guardians suggests Walkers can be beaten by focusing fire on the legs, overloading the Walker and rendering its armored core briefly vulnerable. When the Walker stumbles, Guardians should focus all available firepower on the exposed components beneath the neck plating. Some externally mounted weapons can also be disabled with precise fire.",

        "cardDescription": "Something hit us. Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the Traveler saved us, and at a shattering cost.<br/><br/>\nThe Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the Collapse. Legend calls it the Darkness, the Traveler&#39;s ancient enemy, which hunted it across space.<br/><br/>\nAll we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to competing arguments on the nature of the Darkness and the Collapse.<br/><br/>\nThe Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical and moral presence, an actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a corruption that emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.<br/><br/>\nSaint-14&#39;s Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada, an alien force of incredible - but tangible - power. Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by the Traveler for their sins.<br/><br/>\nUlan-Tan&#39;s Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler&#39;s goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by healing the Traveler.<br/><br/>\nThe Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal powers by bending the rules.<br/><br/>\nThe Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.<br/><br/>\nCertain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army. The Binary Star cult is one notable example.",

        "cardDescription": "I drive myself to the edge of madness trying to explain the truth.<br/><br/>\nIt&#39;s so simple. Elegant like a knife point. It explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING. <br/><br/>\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you&#39;ve just been exhaling dust. Maybe they&#39;re missing some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.<br/><br/>\nWhy does anything exist?<br/><br/>\nNo no no no no don&#39;t reach for that word. There&#39;s no &#39;reason&#39;. That&#39;s teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.<br/><br/>\nWhy do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.<br/><br/>\nAtoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It&#39;s the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)<br/><br/>\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it&#39;s so simple WHY DON&#39;T YOU SEE <br/><br/>\nImagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.<br/><br/>\nThe future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.<br/><br/>\nThis explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants - molecules or stars or people or ideas - will flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.<br/><br/>\nAnd as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.<br/><br/>\nEverything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning play.<br/><br/>\nOf course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.<br/><br/>\nBut I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies. And that is all that will matter in the end.",

The facts won&#39;t sync with the reality, but they&#39;ll be close, and there&#39;s no one to say otherwise, so for all intents and purposes, this will be the history of a settlement we called Palamon and the horrors that followed an all too brief peace.<br/><br/>\nI remember home, and stories of a paradise we&#39;d all get to see some day - of a City, &quot;shining even in the night.&quot; Palamon didn&#39;t shine, but it was sanctuary, of a sort. <br/><br/>\nWe&#39;d settled in the heart of a range that stretched the horizon. Wooded mountains that shot with purpose toward the sky. Winters were harsh, but the trees and peaks hid us from the world. We talked about moving on, sometimes, striking out for the City. But it was just a longing.<br/><br/>\nDrifters came and went. On occasion they would stay, but rarely. <br/>\nWe had no real government, but there was rule of law. Basic tenets agreed upon by all and eventually overseen by Magistrate Loken.<br/><br/>\nAnd there you have it...no government, until there was. I was young, so I barely understood. I remember Loken as a hardworking man who just became broken. Mostly I think he was sad. Sad and frightened. As his fingers tightened on Palamon, people left. Those who stayed saw our days became grey. Loken&#39;s protection - from the Fallen, from ourselves - became dictatorial. <br/><br/>\nLooking back, I think maybe Loken had just lost too much - of himself, his family. But everyone lost something. And some of us had nothing to begin with. My only memory of my parents is a haze, like a daydream, and a small light, like the spark of their souls. It&#39;s not anything I dwell on. They left me early, taken by Dregs.<br/><br/>\nPalamon raised me from there. The family I call my own - called my own - cared for me as if I was their natural born son. And life was good. Being the only life I knew, my judgment is skewed, and it wasn&#39;t easy - pocked by loss as it was - but I would call it good.<br/><br/>\nUntil, of course, it wasn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nUntil two men entered my world. One a light. The other the darkest shadow I would ever know.",

        "cardDescription": "The man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, my third father and quite possibly my closest friend, came to Palamon from the south.<br/><br/>\nI was just a boy, but I&#39;ll never forget his silhouette on the empty trail as he made his slow walk into town.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d never seen anything like him. Maybe none of us had. He&#39;d said he was only passing through, and I believed him - still do, but life can get in the way of intent, and often does.<br/><br/>\nI can picture that day with near perfect clarity. Of all the details though - every nuance, every moment - the memory that sticks in my mind is the iron on Jaren&#39;s hip. A cannon that looked both pristine and lived in. Like a relic of every battle he&#39;d ever fought, hung low at his waist - a trophy and a warning.<br/><br/>\nThis man was dangerous, but there was a light about him - a pureness to his weight - that seemed to hint that his ire was something earned, not carelessly given.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d been the first to see him as he approached, but soon most of Palamon had turned out to greet him. My father held me back as everyone stood in silence.<br/><br/>\nJaren didn&#39;t make a sound behind his sleek racer&#39;s helmet. He looked just like the heroes in the stories, and to this day I&#39;m not sure one way or the other if the silence between the town&#39;s people and the adventurer was born of fear or respect. I like to think the latter, but any truth I try to place on the moment would be of my own making.<br/><br/>\nAs we waited for Magistrate Loken to arrive and make an official greeting, my patience got the best of me. I shook free of my father&#39;s heavy hand and made the short sprint across the court, stopping a few paces from where this new curiosity stood - a man unlike any other.<br/><br/>\nI stared up at him and he lowered his attention to me, his eyes hidden behind the thick tinted visor of his headgear. My sight quickly fell to his sidearm. I was transfixed by it. I imagined all the places that weapon had been. All of the wonders it had seen. The horrors it had endured. My imagination darted from one heroic act to the next.<br/><br/>\nI barely registered when he began to kneel, holding out the iron as if an offering. But my eyes locked onto the piece, mesmerized. <br/><br/>\nI recall turning back to my father and seeing the looks on the faces of everyone I knew. There was worry there - my father slowly shaking his head as if pleading with me to ignore the gift. <br/><br/>\nI turned back to the man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, the finest Hunter this system may ever know and one of the greatest Guardians to ever defend the Traveler&#39;s Light...<br/><br/>\nAnd I took the weapon in my hand. Carefully. Gently.<br/><br/>\nNot to use. But to observe. To imagine. To feel its weight and know its truth.<br/><br/>\nThat was the first time I held &quot;Last Word,&quot; but, unfortunately, not the last.",

        "cardDescription": "It was the fourth night of the seventh moon.<br/><br/>\nNine rises since any sign.<br/><br/>\nTrail wasn&#39;t cold, but lukewarm would&#39;ve been an exaggeration.<br/><br/>\nJaren had us hold by a ravine.<br/><br/>\nThe heavy wood along the cliffs&#39; edge caught the wind, holding back the cold and the rush of water muffled our conversation.<br/><br/>\nWe&#39;d seen dual Skiffs hanging low as they cut through the valley.<br/><br/>\nWasn&#39;t known Fallen territory, but anymore that&#39;s a dangerous assumption.<br/><br/>\nThere were six of us then.<br/><br/>\nThree less than two moons prior, but still, one more than when we&#39;d first turned our backs to Palamon&#39;s ash.<br/><br/>\nWe took a rotation for watch during the night.<br/><br/>\nMovement was kept to a minimum and communication was down to hand signals and simple gestures.<br/><br/>\nWe could hold our own in a fight, but only the dead went looking for one\u2014a hard truth that cut in direct opposition to our reasons for being so far from anything resembling civilization, much less our safety.<br/><br/>\nThe Skiffs had spooked Kressler and Nada, and, in truth, me as well. But, looking back, I think we were all just grasping for any good reason to turn back.<br/><br/>\nNot because we would\u2014turn back\u2014but because it seemed to be our only real hope, and I think we all knew it.<br/><br/>\nForward. Where we were headed\u2014into the unknown. And following the footsteps we were. It all just started to feel like a never-ending dead end after a while.<br/><br/>\nJaren never wavered though. Not once.<br/><br/>\nAt least not to any noticeable degree.<br/><br/>\nIt was his drive, his conviction, that kept us going.<br/><br/>\nAnd\u2014it&#39;s hard to think on\u2014but if I&#39;m honest, it was his death that rekindled my own fire. A fire that was all but exhausted on that cold night.<br/><br/>\nHe seemed confident we were close.<br/><br/>\nBut more than confident\u2014sure. He seemed sure.<br/><br/>\nNo one else felt it\u2014our own confidence, and any enthusiasm we&#39;d had was set to wither soon as Brevin, Trenn and Mel were gunned down.<br/><br/>\nThe Ghost\u2014Jaren&#39;s Ghost\u2014never said a word to any of us. Just hung there. Always alert. Always judging. Not us, per se, but the moment. Any moment.<br/><br/>\nI never got the sense it thought of us as lesser. More that it was guarded, wary.<br/><br/>\nWe knew it could speak. We&#39;d overheard them a few times. Just brief words, and no one ever pressed the subject.<br/><br/>\nFrom time to time I caught its gaze lingering on me, but always assumed the attention was a result of the bond Jaren and I had. He was a father to me. At the time I didn&#39;t know why he&#39;d singled me out as someone to care for. Someone to protect. After all the loss, I welcomed it, but looking back\u2014taking in the arm&#39;s length at which he kept the others\u2014I guess I should&#39;ve known, or at least suspected there was more to it.<br/><br/>\nWe all woke that night, closer to morning than the previous day.<br/><br/>\nA crack of gunfire split through the wood. Then more.<br/><br/>\nFar off, but near enough to pump the blood.<br/><br/>\nA familiar ring. &quot;Last Word.&quot; Jaren&#39;s sidearm. His best friend.<br/>\nThen another. A single shot, an unmistakable echo calling through the night. Hushed, cutting.<br/><br/>\nOne shot, dark and infernal. Followed by silence.<br/><br/>\nWe crouched low and quiet. Listening. Hoping.<br/><br/>\nJaren was gone. Off on his own.<br/><br/>\nMaybe we were closer than we&#39;d allowed ourselves to believe.<br/><br/>\nToo close.<br/><br/>\nHe&#39;d gone to face death alone.<br/><br/>\nI couldn&#39;t admit it\u2014not at the time\u2014but he thought he was <br/>\nprotecting us.<br/><br/>\nAfter such a long road\u2014years on its heels, a trail littered with suffering and fire\u2014maybe he just couldn&#39;t take the thought of anymore dead &quot;kids,&quot; as he called us.<br/><br/>\nThe echoes faded and we all held still. No way to track the direction. No sense in rushing blind.<br/><br/>\nWhat was done was done.<br/><br/>\nThe cadence of the shots fired told a story none of us cared to hear.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Last Word&quot; it hadn&#39;t been. And somewhere in the world, close enough for us to bear absent witness but far enough to be a dream, Jaren Ward lay dead or dying. And there was nothing to be done.<br/><br/>\nHours passed. An eternity.<br/><br/>\nWe held our spot, but as the sun rose the others began to fade back into the world. Without Jaren there was nothing holding us together. No driving force. Vengeance had grown stale as a motivator. Fear and a longing to see more suns rise drove a wedge between duty and desire.<br/><br/>\nBy midday I was alone. I couldn&#39;t leave. Wouldn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nEither I would find Jaren and set him at ease, or the other would find me and that would be a fitting end.<br/><br/>\nDeath marching on.<br/><br/>\nBut then, a motion. Quick and darting. My muscles tensed and my hand shot to the grip of my leadslinger.<br/><br/>\nThen a confirmation of the horrible truth I had already accepted, as Jaren&#39;s Ghost came to a halt a few paces in front of me.<br/><br/>\nI exhaled and slumped forward. Still standing, but broken.<br/>\nThe tiny Light looked me over with a curious tilt to its axis, then shot a beam of light over my body. Scanning me as it had done the very first time we met.<br/><br/>\nI looked up. Staring into its singular glowing eye.<br/><br/>\nAnd it spoke...",

        "cardDescription": "The noble man stood. And the people looked to him. For he was a beacon - hope given form, yet still only a man. And within that truth there was great promise. If one man could stand against the night, then so too could anyone - everyone.<br/><br/>\nIn his strong hand the man held a Rose. And his aura burned bright.<br/><br/>\nWhen the man journeyed on, the people remembered. In his wake hope spread. But the man had a secret fear. His thoughts were dark. A sadness crept from the depths of his being. He had been a hero for so long, but pride had led him down sorrow&#39;s road.<br/><br/>\nSlowly the shadows&#39; whisper became a voice, a dark call, offering glories enough to make even the brightest Light wander. He knew he was fading, yet he still yearned.<br/><br/>\nOn his last day he sat and watched the sun fall. His final thoughts, pure of mind, if not body, held to a fleeting hope - though they would suffer for the man he would become, the people would remember him as he had been.<br/><br/>\nAnd so the noble man hid himself beneath a darkness no flesh should touch, and gave up his mortal self to claim a new birthright. Whether this was choice, or destiny, is a truth known only to fate.<br/><br/>\nIn that cool evening air, as dusk was devoured by night, the noble man ceased to exist. In his place another stood. <br/><br/>\nSame meat. Same bone. But so very different.<br/><br/>\nThe first and only of his family. The sole forbearer and last descendent of the name Yor.<br/><br/>\nIn his first moments as a new being, he looked down at his Rose and realized for the first time that it held no petals: only the jagged purpose of angry thorns.",

Lesser.<br/>\n[u.1:0.5] Some would say.<br/>\n[u.2:0.5] But what would you say?<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:0.6] All we\u2019ve seen and now, here with me, you have no words.<br/>\n[u.1:0.6] I have words.<br/>\n[u.2:0.7] But...?<br/>\n[u.1:0.7] But you will not like them.<br/>\n[u.2:0.8] There is much I do not like.<br/>\n[u.1:0.8] More now than ever it would seem.<br/>\n[u.2:0.9] Heh.<br/>\n[u.1:0.9] I find no laughing matter in your path.<br/>\n[u.2:1.0] Only in the journey.<br/>\n[u.1:1.0] What brought you here was nobility.<br/>\n[u.2:1.1] And my prize.<br/>\n[u.1:1.1] That is no prize.<br/>\n[u.2:1.2] A curse then?<br/>\n[u.1:1.2] I would say.<br/>\n[u.2:1.3] And I would disagree.<br/>\n[u.1:1.3] You are no longer yourself.<br/>\n[u.2:1.4] I am myself. It\u2019s who I was that\u2019s gone.<br/>\n[u.1:1.4] Who you were held all the value.<br/>\n[u.2:1.5] To you.<br/>\n[u.1:1.5] To the Light.<br/>\n[u.2:1.6] The Light...<br/>\n[u.1:1.6] It is all.<br/>\n[u.2:1.7] It is nothing but a crutch.<br/>\n[u.1:1.7] One that has held you up.<br/>\n[u.2:1.8] Only just. And nothing more.<br/>\n[u.1:1.8] Nothing more? You were a hero.<br/>\n[u.2:1.9] And yet people still die. Corruption still exists. Light still fades. And Darkness still spreads.<br/>\n[u.1:1.9] As it will ever be, that doesn\u2019t mean you give in to...<br/>\n[u.2:2.0] To what? Hope.<br/>\n[u.1:2.0] This is not hope.<br/>\n[u.2:2.1] This is peace.<br/>\n[u.1:2.1] You have blood on your hands.<br/>\n[u.2:2.2] How\u2019s that any different than prior?<br/>\n[u.1:2.2] Innocent blood.<br/>\n[u.2:2.3] Matter of perspective.<br/>\n[u.1:2.3] That\u2019s the shadow talking.<br/>\n[u.2:2.4] And am I not.<br/>\n[u.1:2.4] The shadow?<br/>\n[u.2:2.5] Ya know... These past cycles, you\u2019ve made an honorable effort. Tried your best to correct my course. But I don\u2019t know it needs correcting.<br/>\n[u.1:2.5] And if it does?<br/>\n[u.2:2.6] Could be too late.<br/>\n[u.1:2.6] &#39;Could be&#39; is a winding path.<br/>\n[u.2:2.7] Long way from where I was to where I\u2019m going.<br/>\n[u.1:2.7] That is my hope. That there is still time.<br/>\n[u.2:2.8] For?<br/>\n[u.1:2.8] Corrective measures. The righting of our path. The cleansing of your shadow and a return to the Light.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:2.9] Why\u2019d you pick me?<br/>\n[u.1:2.9] It doesn\u2019t work that way.<br/>\n[u.2:3.0] Was I special?<br/>\n[u.1:3.0] You were.<br/>\n[u.2:3.1] But only as special as any other.<br/>\n[u.1:3.1] You are all special.<br/>\n[u.2:3.2] Seems to contradict the word don\u2019t it.<br/>\n[u.1:3.2] Not in my estimation.<br/>\n[u.2:3.3] If we\u2019re all special, are any of us special?<br/>\n[u.1:3.3] Is that what you want? To be special?<br/>\n[u.2:3.4] Heh.<br/>\n[u.1:3.4] You dismiss, but it\u2019s a very serious question. Is that all you\u2019re after? Is all of the death worth that badge?<br/>\n[u.2:3.5] Am I not already more than the rest?<br/>\n[u.1:3.5] Looking at you here, now. The smoke, ash and bone at your feet mark you as so much less.<br/>\n[u.2:3.6] Maybe. And yet here you are.<br/>\n[u.1:3.6] Meaning?<br/>\n[u.2:3.7] You have been at my side every step of the way.<br/>\n[u.1:3.7] Where else would I be?<br/>\n[u.2:3.8] Yet you disagree so thoroughly with my change in perspective.<br/>\n[u.1:3.8] If only the change was simply one of perspective. Your \u201cevolution\u201d was no choice. This is not you having come to an understanding after careful considered thought. This is corruption.<br/>\n[u.2:3.9] The shadows?<br/>\n[u.1:3.9] The Darkness.<br/>\n[u.2:4.0] Maybe so.<br/>\n[u.1:4.0] There is no maybe here.<br/>\n[u.2:4.1] And you think you can save me?<br/>\n[u.1:4.1] I rekindled your Light, it falls first to me to aid in its survival.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:4.2] I tire of it.<br/>\n[u.1:4.2] You must try...<br/>\n[u.2:4.3] I tire of you.<br/>\n[u.1:4.3] [REDACTED]...<br/>\n[u.2:4.4] That is no longer my name.<br/>\n[u.1:4.4] I will not speak the other.<br/>\n[u.2:4.5] It doesn\u2019t matter. This is where we part ways.<br/>\n[u.1:4.5] I will not leave you.<br/>\n[u.2:4.6] I am leaving you.<br/>\n[u.1:4.6] Without me, your journey ahead will be more than any one Guardian can handle.<br/>\n[u.2:4.7] That\u2019s the point. It\u2019s been sometime since you saw me as worthy of walking among those I once called brother and sister. Yet... anymore, I feel as though I am worthy of so much more.<br/>\n[u.1:4.7] Without me... You will die.<br/>\n[u.2:4.8] Someday. Won\u2019t be the first time.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:4.9] Consider this my last good deed. I am releasing you of the burden of my deeds, both done and yet to come.<br/>\n[u.1:4.8] I will not abandon you.<br/>\n[u.2:5.0] You will. Or I will carve the Light from your shell and leave the carcass of my first and last friend in the dirt of this dull, red world for no one to find.<br/>\n[u.1:4.9] Then I\u2019ve failed you, completely.<br/>\n[u.2:5.1] Not me. Maybe the man I was.<br/>\n[u.1:5.0] He is truly dead.<br/>\n[u.2:5.2] I believe so.<br/>\n[u.1:5.1] Belief is not fact.<br/>\n[u.2:5.3] Semantics I no longer have the patience for.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:5.4] When you speak of me, use my proper name. Tell them of the man that stands before you, not the ghost of the hero I once was.<br/>\n[u.1:5.2] You will always be [REDACTED] to me.<br/>\n[u.2:5.5] If you cannot let that man go, you will forever taint his legacy. All the good I have ever done will be washed away in the fire of who I have become.<br/>\n[u.1:5.3] If you care, there is still some promise within you.<br/>\n[u.2:5.6] If I am being honest, I care only to give hope to the frightened, huddled masses so that when I come upon them they will have more to lose. Their pain will be greater. Their screams more pure. <br/>\n[u.1:5.4] You...<br/>\n[u.2:5.7] Nothing dies like hope. I cherish it. <br/>\n[u.1:5.5] You\u2019re a monster.<br/>\n[u.2:5.8] Finally, you see the truth.<br/>\n[u.1:5.6] [REDACTED] is truly dead.<br/>\n[u.2:5.9] So I\u2019ve said. Long live Dredgen Yor.<br/>\n[u.1:5.7] This is farewell, but you can only run from your sins so far. In the end, you will die alone.<br/>\n[u.2:6.0] Maybe so. But I gotta tell ya... I tend to like my odds.<br/>\n[u.1:5.8] Your tainted \u201cRose\u201d will not always save you.<br/>\n[u.2:6.1] Old friend... It already has.",

Executor, Mercury is a beautiful place, and forbidding. On descent we mapped sprawling patterns of Vex light, an entire metropolis of unknown purpose. The Spires strobe with lightning. A mist of burnt rock or some other effluvia blows across landscape cut into circuits the size of cities. There is an atmosphere, as in all post-Traveler records. The Vex have not disposed of it.<br/><br/>\nFrom the surface the Sun is too large and too dim. Perhaps it is the influence of the Vex constructs distorting the image. Perhaps Mercury is in many places at once. We stood for some time staring into the solar fire. I hold myself responsible for the delay.<br/><br/>\nThe site we were invited to is clearly a Cult of Osiris camp. We found stores of Glimmer, equipment, and books. A grounded ship of conventional design rests unguarded. The architecture is clearly, self-evidently Vex, but it has been ornamented extensively with fabrics and ritual objects of unknown provenance.<br/><br/>\nI became convinced during the inspection that we were being watched. We ordered our Ghosts to stay close. One of my Fireteam suggested we search for connections to the Trinary Star cultists, but if they exist we couldn&#39;t see them.<br/><br/>\nWe inspected the carvings and trinkets left by the Osiris cultists. All of us began to depart from ordinary experience. My Exo teammate described the sense that she was buried beneath an enormous, operating mass\u2014 locked up in a tiny crevasse at the bottom of a labyrinth or mechanism. My Awoken teammate felt an ongoing sense of deja vu: her actions were precessed by an infinite echo, an anticipation of all her choices. She became volatile and erratic. She insisted that we were surrounded.<br/><br/>\nI remember a low ringing sound and a sense of numb filth, like gravel rubbed into a wound. I experienced a sense of immanence, as if I was bleeding into the world around me. It was uncomfortable and profoundly alienating. I perceived all my actions as determined and inevitable.<br/><br/>\nMy Ghost commented that the Traveler had made something of this world, and then Vex had eaten that something.<br/><br/>\nWe gathered the treasure left for us and departed as quickly as we could.<br/><br/>\nThis concludes my report. May it bring some advantage to our cause.",

        "cardDescription": "The Traveler changed everything. It reshaped our solar system as decisively as it shattered our scientific and philosophical frameworks. To our ancestors it must have been a hammerblow - a glimpse beyond the horizon of expected possibility and into a realm of transcendent power.<br/><br/>\nThe Traveler kindled the Golden Age. But we built it. We remember this with pride, even after so much else has been lost. We settled our solar system and filled it with our work.<br/><br/>\nToday Cryptarchs and scholars work to distill the legends of the Golden Age into truth. We know that humans lived longer, flew further, and knew more. We know that countless ancient diseases and hatreds were extinguished forever. Human aspiration gives birth to vast engineering projects, sweeping social movements, and even new forms of life.<br/><br/>\nThe Golden Age was not without challenges. Sources speak of internal strife, philosophical rifts- particularly around questions of machine intelligence and &#39;mind forking&#39; - and enduring scientific enigmas. But humanity and its machine children tackled these problems with pride, vigor, and a contagious sense of pluralist compassion.",

When I was your age, I was a genius.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;You&#39;re smart now,&quot; I said.<br/><br/>\nHe laughed hard.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Look around,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>\nI always look around.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Miss nothing,&quot; he told me.<br/><br/>\nFather was standing beside a big gray building.<br/><br/>\n&quot;This is what I want you to see,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>\nThe building had no doors or windows.  <br/><br/>\n&quot;Do you know how to make a strong password?&quot; he asked.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know if I do,&quot; I said.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Tell yourself a story,&quot; he said. &quot;Use that one good story you&#39;ll never forget, that you can carry forever. Let your story take odd turns and wear a few surprising marks, make sure it belongs to you, so you can keep it secret.&quot;<br/><br/>\nFather kneeled, putting our faces close...<br/><br/>\n&quot;I want to show you something special,&quot; he said. &quot;Something rare.&quot;<br/><br/>\nI tried to imagine what that might be.<br/><br/>\n&quot;No,&quot; he warned. &quot;You can&#39;t guess.&quot;<br/><br/>\nInside the gray building was a diamond wall...A projected sky floated above us. It wasn&#39;t our sky, alive with metal and light. Nothing about the grayness was wet and nothing looked alive. I had never seen a sadder piece of ground.<br/><br/>\n&quot;This was our world,&quot; Father said. &quot;When I was your age.&quot;<br/><br/>\nI touched the diamond wall. He watched my hand jump back.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Hot,&quot; I said.<br/><br/>\nHe laughed quietly.<br/><br/>\nI shook my burnt hand, and it felt better.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Our world was this. The entire planet was a furnace. Acidic. Dead in so many ways. And I was your age.&quot;<br/><br/>\nI was bored with the dead world. I looked at Father&#39;s face, asking, &quot;Can we leave?&quot;<br/><br/>\nHe started to reach for my hair again but decided not to.<br/><br/>\nI was bored with everything.<br/><br/>\n&quot;When I was your age, people thought they knew almost everything. We had scientific laws and human truths, even a model of the universe. People carried pictures of the past and tried to have a clear vision of their difficult future. I didn&#39;t know everything, of course. But when I was a boy, I had every expectation of living a smart short life and learning quite a lot more. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Then the Before was finished.<br/><br/>\n&quot;You know why.<br/><br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s when everybody, particularly the smartest of us, learned that we knew nothing. We were children and our little ideas were toys, and the universe was cut apart with great ideas and magnificent, immeasurable potentials.&quot;<br/><br/>\nFather stopped talking.<br/><br/>\nI stepped away from the hot diamond wall.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Do you know what I wanted to show you?&quot; Father asked.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Dead rock,&quot; I said.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Guess again.&quot; He wasn&#39;t happy with me.<br/><br/>\nWe stepped back into the real sun, the real world. I blinked and looked around, surprised by how green and bright everything was. How happy everything was. Even the saddest face was happy.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I know what you want me to see,&quot; I said.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t tell me,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell him.",

His Ghost peeked out over his shoulder.<br/><br/>\nLoken took in the crowd before stepping forward, as if to claim the ground - his ground. &quot;You question me?&quot; There was venom in his words. &quot;This is not your home.&quot;<br/><br/>\nI remember Loken&#39;s gestures here. Making a show of it all.<br/><br/>\nEveryone else was still. Quiet.<br/><br/>\nI tugged at my father&#39;s sleeve, but he just tightened his grip on my shoulder to the point pain. His way of letting me know that this was not the time.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d watched Jaren&#39;s every move over the past months, mapping his effortless gestures and slight, earned mannerisms. I&#39;d never seen anything like him. He was something I couldn&#39;t comprehend, and yet I felt I understood all I needed the moment I&#39;d seen him. He was more than us. Not better. Not superior. Just more.<br/><br/>\nI wanted father to stop what was happening. Looking back now, I realize that he didn&#39;t want to stop it. No one d id.<br/><br/>\nAs Loken belittled Jaren Ward, taunted him, enumerated his crimes and sins, my eyes were stuck on Jaren&#39;s pistol, fixed to his hip. His steady hand resting calmly on his belt.<br/><br/>\nI remembered the pistol&#39;s weight. Effortless. And my concern faded. I understood.<br/><br/>\n&quot;This is our town! My town!&quot; Loken was shouting now. He was going to make a show of Jaren - teach the people of Palamon a lesson in obedience.<br/><br/>\nJaren spoke: clear, calm. &quot;Not anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>\nLoken laughed dismissively. He had nine guns on his side. &quot;Those gonna be your last words then, boy?&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe movement was a flash: quick as chain lightning. Jaren Ward spoke as he moved. &quot;Yours. Not mine.&quot;<br/><br/>\nSmoke trailed from Jaren&#39;s revolver.<br/><br/>\nLoken hit the ground. A dark hole in his forehead. Eyes staring into eternity.<br/><br/>\nJaren stared down the nine guns trained on him. One by one, they lowered their aim. And the rest of my life began - where, in a few short years, so many others would be ended.",

Warlords and wilderness fiefdoms clung to power. Starvation, disease, and anarchy menaced. But the Guardians held the frontier, and the children of the Golden Age kept the fire burning through the long climb back.<br/><br/>\nLegends walk through this history. The Iron Lords. Saint-14&#39;s crusade against the Fallen. The mask of the Speaker. The great Ahamkara Hunt. Toland&#39;s madness. Terrible Faction Wars - and the horrifying, disastrous effort to retake the Moon. <br/><br/>\nAs the City learned to walk again, it found a world overrun by alien menace. It faced disaster and defeat. Even in recent years, as Guardians begin to venture back to the Moon and the inner planets, the City&#39;s territory has withdrawn - outer sections abandoned and converted into fortifications in the wake of the Battle of Twilight Gap.<br/><br/>\nBut the City&#39;s shipwrights and foundries hum with energy. The probability kilns and work cooperatives produce new wonders. The Darkness is rising again. But so is the Light.",

He&#39;ll continue his crusade from wherever we stuff him.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;And so we&#39;ll need to find some new ideas to replace his.&quot; <br/><br/>\n&quot;The Symmetry has been gaining a strong following...&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Ulan-Tan&#39;s teachings are too dangerous. Too much fear. Who knew he&#39;d be more trouble dead than alive?&quot; <br/><br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ll need to refocus our collective minds on combat. The Speaker&#39;s anxious to regain ground we lost after the Gap.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;There is the War Cult.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Too secretive. Have you ever tried to talk to one of their &#39;soldiers&#39;? Like a child. Answering questions with questions.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;They are dedicated to the war.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Which one?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Good question.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Zavala?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;They seem focused. Strong. More interesting than worrisome.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s take it to a vote. All in favor of the ascension of the Future War Cult?&quot; <br/><br/>\n&quot;Unanimous? Good. We&#39;ll grant the Future War Cult access to the Tower and a seat among us. Ghost, please offer the Speaker this proposal.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Now onto the next order of business...Shaxx is here with another proposal for his Crucible.&quot;",

Demand it and it&#39;s yours. At Clovis Bray, we have a singular understanding of genius, and we appreciate how brilliant minds flourish when they enjoy total freedom.<br/><br/>\nThis is Freehold, the realm where the new and the best is born. This is where your brilliance, freed of budget constraints and managers, makes the universe dance.<br/><br/>\nClovis Bray is a nursery, a nursery to a million marvels. Your inventions belong to no one but you. Cherish them, praise them. Or tell them they aren&#39;t worthy and set them inside a deep dark drawer.<br/><br/>\nBut as every parent soon learns, children grow up. And every technology matures. At some point, your inventions are going to find mates. They&#39;ll join with other marvels and produce a new generation of offspring.<br/><br/>\nMaybe you&#39;ll build a better reactor.<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile, the genius in the lab next door devises an elegant way to fold machines into tiny spaces.<br/><br/>\nYour device meets hers, and a fierce little reactor is born.<br/><br/>\nYour children are yours forever. And we are happy to arrange for their grandchildren to prosper.",

        "cardDescription": "Didn&#39;t anyone tell you about the Prison of Elders? Weren&#39;t you on the strike team that killed that Archon Priest, the one who escaped? Okay, okay, I&#39;ll tell the story about the Prison of Elders...<br/><br/>\nThe Awoken will tell you that a long time ago the Queen conquered the House of Wolves. What they won&#39;t say, because they are very serious important people, is that the House of Wolves did a lot of the job for them. After the Queen killed the Wolf Kell, the Fallen started competing for the throne. One of the first battles was called the Eos Clash and I wasn&#39;t anywhere near it, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not making this up. A Fallen named Skolas wiped out one of his rivals in the Eos Clash. But the battle cost him so much he got to thinking: if the Reef killed my boss, and gave me a chance at the throne, maybe I can use the Reef to kill all my rivals too!<br/><br/>\nPretty good, right? When they told me I had to be a Vanguard I went to ask some Fallen how I could get out of it, but they just told me to kill all my friends and then myself. Anyway.<br/><br/>\nEveryone involved in the civil war started trying to play their rivals against each other, and the Awoken too. No one wanted to become so strong that they&#39;d be a target. No one wanted to bleed their own forces dry doing someone else&#39;s dirty work. Cutthroat politics! And who&#39;s the best at cutthroat politics? That&#39;s right, her Majesty, the Queen of the Reef.<br/><br/>\nAt the end of the wars, the Queen had played her way into the strongest position, and she had a collection of Fallen nobility and servitors she thought might be useful to her. Of course she thought so! She&#39;d just used them against each other and won absolute control of the Reef, the Belt, and the House of Wolves. She wasn&#39;t about to just toss away her playing pieces.<br/><br/>\nShe kept them frozen in her prison, the Prison of Elders, and she gave the keys to that prison to my buddy Variks, a Fallen who showed her loyalty. The Prison of Elders is a really curious thing. It holds creatures of enormous power. Not just Wolf nobility\u2014 all kinds of beasts, captured by Corsair expeditions or lured in by the Queen. And it holds them well. The Queen, she can do things I don&#39;t understand. There&#39;s a power behind her, or in her, that values that Prison.<br/><br/>\nBut I hear there&#39;s been a few prison breaks. Some old Kell got the old House of Wolves back together.<br/><br/>\nNow, she&#39;s started to wake up her captives. Variks is inviting Guardians out to the Reef to do battle with them in an arena\u2014show valor, earn rewards. It&#39;s been their Crucible. Maybe the Queen wants her collection thinned out. Maybe the Queen wants Guardians in the Reef, to deter more unrest. Maybe the Queen wants intelligence on how her prizes fight.<br/><br/>\nMaybe she wants intelligence on how WE fight.<br/><br/>\nWhatever happens\u2014 I want you to remember that she knows, more than anyone else I&#39;ve met, how to set one foe against another.",

Not that there&#39;d be anyone on the listening end either, from what I can see. My Queen,&quot; she added hastily, as Shuro glared.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Comms are no longer a priority,&quot; said Mara. &quot;Focus on resealing the Hulls, and any other habitable vessels we have. Bring anything you can as close to Vesta as possible. The closer people are to me, the safer they are.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe engineer nodded uncertainly. &quot;Yes. My Queen.&quot;<br/><br/>\nMara nodded. &quot;You may go.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe engineer bowed, and left the room. As soon as the hatch closed behind her, Mara raised her hand.

Mara closed her eyes. A hum rose from the Techeuns, the notes fracturing into harmonies as, from the shadows, hundreds of tiny blue sparks burst to life before her. Then Mara inclined her head, and the sparks began to rush by as if she was plunging through them, each streak of blue burning a swath in her vision. As the last spark vanished, Mara saw darkness once again, a long, stretching, empty darkness\u2014and then another cloud of  sparks burst forth. These were smaller than the others, their tiny flames guttering and flickering, and there were fewer of them too, but Mara inhaled and the sparks rushed toward her, growing bigger as they flew.<br/><br/>\n&quot;We should have stayed in the Reef...&quot; &quot;...Says there&#39;s one city left...&quot; &quot;A City beneath the Traveler...&quot; &quot;At least we&#39;re not in the Reef...&quot; The voices broke over Mara like a wave and for a moment she spun in the currents.<br/><br/>\nNow, in the flames, shapes began to form. A crashed ship\u2014a blue-skinned hand clasping a brown one\u2014a half-built wall high above the treetops.<br/><br/>\n&quot;You who betrayed us for Earth!&quot; Mara thought. &quot;It is I, your Queen! I will grant you one chance to return, or you will not be welcomed back!&quot;<br/><br/>\nBut the tide of voices never wavered.",

STAND BY FOR SNAP.<br/>\nMESSAGE TO FOLLOW<br/><br/>\nPUBLIC KEY 080 641 DWS REGAL<br/>\nFROM: PLDN ABRA ZIRE [PLDN CMD TF 4.1]<br/>\nTO: ALL TASK GROUP ELEMENT LEADERS<br/>\nSUBJECT: OPLAN AND FRAGMENT ORDERS<br/><br/>\nMESSAGE IS:<br/><br/>\n1. Beltrik the Veiled [HVT R3] and loyal spaceborne elements have been localized to 19 Fortuna. Beltrik is chief Wolf strategist. Corsair recon confirms that HVT R3 ships are resupplying ether and performing high-tempo logistical operations. Recon elements and COLLABINT sources agree that Beltrik will roll one ship at a time into the resupply pocket while holding all other assets to screen.<br/><br/>\n2. TF 4.1 will attack. Targets are HVT R3 spaceborne assets. Objective is annihilation of spaceborne assets and capture/nullification of HVT R3. Designate targets VEIL HAND.<br/><br/>\n2a. Due to history of violence between PLDN CMD TF 4.1 and HVT R3, particularly Battle of False Tidings/Hildian Campaign, Beltrik expects TF 4.1 to engage his screen directly. We will exploit this expectation. Fragment orders follow.<br/><br/>\n3. PETRA VENJ will detach select warships and air wing elements to form TF 4.2 MASS LENS. TF 4.2 is directed to engage VEIL HAND screen elements with skirmishers. TF 4.2 will deny main battle while pinning down VEIL HAND forces at 19 Fortuna. TF 4.2 will receive missile and torpedo assets to force VEIL HAND into maintaining tight mutual CIWS/ESM support.<br/><br/>\n3a. Decisive engagement with VEIL HAND in 4.2 MASS LENS AO is forbidden until GO CONTINGENCY satisfied. Prioritize FORCECON.<br/><br/>\n4. Remaining TF 4.1 will maneuver immediately to rendezvous with 687 Tinette. Tinette is on close approach with 19 Fortuna. TF 4.1 frigates and fighters will perform recon denial against VEIL HAND scouts.<br/><br/>\n4a. Upon rendezvous with 687 Tinette, TF 4.1 will deploy CARYBDIS. ***This is a CARYBDIS RELEASE (MAJESTY DIRECT)!***. TF 4.1 will maneuver in Tinette&#39;s shadow as it retrajectorizes for intercept.<br/><br/>\n5. GO CONTINGENCY: Upon collision of 687 Tinette and 19 Fortuna TF 4.1 and TF 4.2 will IMMEDIATELY close for decisive engagement. VEIL HAND C4I will be critically degraded and all targets will be maneuvering away from mutual support. Skirmishers and air wing will provide TARCAP and destroy VEIL HAND light warships as they attempt to reform. EWAR assets will isolate hostile heavy warships from C4I and spoof bad datalinks. Main combatants will cripple VEIL HAND heavy warships and board where opportune.<br/><br/>\n6. NO HARBINGER SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE.<br/><br/>\n7. Good luck. The Reef and the Queen are watching.<br/><br/>\nMESSAGE ENDS<br/><br/>\nSTOP STOP STOP",

Of course, this also introduces a centralized weakness for enemies to target. But the Vex seem to consider the tradeoff worthwhile.<br/><br/>\nThe Prohibitive Mind seems to coordinate Vex action against Cabal positions in Meridian Bay. The current Vex operational plan - to the extent that we assume the Vex have operational plans - appears to involve an attritional campaign on the surface, supplemented by disruptive use of gates to bypass Cabal hardpoints.",

I&#39;ve finished going over that Ghost&#39;s report. <br/><br/>\nIt is my hypothesis - a hypothesis at best - that the Vex saw the abominable presence at the heart of the Garden as a divine power. I can hear your protest already: how can machines have a god?<br/><br/>\nThe answer is simple. The Vex, for all their voracious intelligence, could not understand or decipher what they found. They searched through all available reactions, and they settled on the course with the greatest payoff...to worship this power, and to remake themselves in its image.<br/><br/>\nI believe the three Axis Minds found in proximity to the abomination were Vex machines built to serve as vessels for this power: a way to extend its reach across space and time, binding it to the Vex, and the Vex to it. If they had succeeded, I cannot begin to guess what horrors they would have unleashed.<br/><br/>\nAttend carefully. There is cause for hope. When endangered, the abomination activated these vessels and defended itself. This tells us that it was threatened. Whatever it was, Guardians could harm it.<br/><br/>\nAnd it activated only a single vessel at a time. Its strength was limited. Whatever it intended, it was not ready yet.<br/><br/>\nWe must assume the abomination was part of something greater. And we cannot flinch from the terrible, obvious comparison: just as the Traveler acts through us, this power was able to act through its own servants.<br/><br/>\nLet us be wary. There may be other abominations, and other vessels.<br/><br/>\nIkora",

With the House of Wolves in disarray, the Queen needs muscle in the Reef. Guardians go where the treasure and the glory are, and an arena of champions is a wonderful place to earn both. Guardians in the Reef deter threats to the Queen and give the Awoken a chance to learn about their power and subvert their loyalty to the Traveler. And if, as the Queen worries, the Nine are scheming against her, then she needs a good excuse to clear out some of the most dangerous prizes in the Prison of Elders.<br/><br/>\nAnd the Prison of Elders is full of dangerous prizes. The Awoken have captured titanically dangerous specimens from everywhere in the inner solar system. These monstrous champions want to smash Guardian bone and Guardian alloy\u2014and given the chance, they&#39;ll kill Guardians, rend their Ghosts, and snuff them out forever. Walk into the arena with a Fireteam you trust. And beware: the agents of the Nine are active in the Reef, and their curiosity is as limitless as it is inscrutable.<br/><br/>\nRisk death.

To know the words is mortal. Oh, good point, Eriana, death is just a word, isn&#39;t it? A catch-all term for the failure to go on, nothing spiritual, nothing with its own quiddity. We all died once, and it did not prove insurmountable.<br/><br/>\nBut what if what if what if, shhh listen, what if death were reified, described in its totality, made autonomous and universal, separate from any context or condition? What if She could invoke the ending of anything?<br/><br/>\nHow, then, would She know the song, and sing it, without Herself dying?<br/><br/>\nPerhaps they know a way to make themselves part of the song, part of something vast and burning that rots and peels into ash but never ever ends. Perhaps She has engineered this for Him, and pinned His power up against the quiddity of death itself.<br/><br/>\nI am so terribly curious to know.",

He found it and he brought it to his quarters so he could sit on it. It&#39;s nothing like a throne. Variks doesn&#39;t want a throne.<br/><br/>\nHe sits on his ancient shrapnel, unmasked, and whittles at an amethyst with the dead edge of a shock dagger. Music plays (something ancient, pre-Whirlwind, beautiful). The ether in the air is rich and it fills him up with strength. Skolas has been captured, mad Skolas who would have ruined everything. Variks should be happy. He&#39;s not. With his little knife and his two arms and his stolen shining thing he feels like a Dreg. He feels ashamed.<br/><br/>\nHe betrayed Skolas twice. At Cybele, and again, now. He will betray Skolas&#39; dream ten times more. Variks will never be strong like Skolas, big like Skolas, a leader like Skolas. Variks will work for the Queen, oversee the Prisons, watch his fellow Fallen (they are Fallen, it&#39;s a good name now) fight and die as gladiators who want nothing except a chance to hurt Guardians. Even Skolas.<br/><br/>\nHe tried to use the Vex, word has it. He tried to use their machines. Has that ever worked for anyone? Maybe one. Maybe a few: the Osiris cultists are Variks&#39; favorite people. Maybe that&#39;s how you survive this alien star where dead gods slumber and dead heroes walk. You cozy up to powers you barely understand and make yourself useful, or at least inoffensive. You become a parasite, a scavenger, a servant.<br/><br/>\nThat&#39;s dreg strength. That&#39;s the strength that keeps Variks alive. It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of.",

        "cardDescription": "Skolas is dead. <br/><br/>\nVariks sits carving at his piece of amethyst. His undocked arms are weaker, less precise, but it is a comfort to feel the crystal press hard into his palm. The knife slips. He cuts himself. &quot;Ai,&quot; he says, and of course right then the door opens, Variks has no privacy, Variks wants no privacy, Variks lives to serve the Queen.<br/><br/>\nIt&#39;s Petra Venj. She&#39;s masked against the ether air. &quot;The Prince wants to speak,&quot; she says, and then, seeing him unmasked and bleeding, she chuckles. Petra depends on Variks for intelligence and Variks, frustrated with her insane risk-taking and bravado, sometimes gives her tips meant to get her killed. Petra has figured this out. Petra and Variks know each other&#39;s agendas and each other&#39;s strengths and to Variks that&#39;s as close as any two people can get. Petra is smart: she sends Guardians now, people who can die as much as they like.<br/><br/>\n&quot;You slipped,&quot; she says.<br/><br/>\nVariks holds up the amethyst in his bleeding hand. It&#39;s a Reef gem. &quot;I wound myself,&quot; he says, &quot;to make this more beautiful.&quot;<br/><br/>\nShe stares into the gem with a distant Awoken eye. What does she see? Variks knows she has visions and he knows those visions haunt her, drive her. The Awoken are twinned to powers that terrify Variks. He&#39;d dock himself again before he&#39;d let the Queen&#39;s witches near him, the witches who raised Petra.<br/><br/>\nThe unfairness of it makes him want to roar. Why does everyone else have this patronage? Why do the Hive have gods and the Vex have sprawling time-bent minds and the Cabal have reinforcements? Why do the Awoken whisper to the stars and listen for the whisper back, the voices from the Jovians, the song in the dark? Why do the Guardians get the Great Machine&#39;s blessing, was it like that before the Whirlwind, were there Fallen heroes crowned in Ghosts who strode the battlefield fearless and full of Light? Why do they tell stories about reclaiming the lost glory of humanity, and no stories about the lost glory of Variks&#39; people, the House of Judgment that once kept codes of dignity and law?<br/><br/>\nWhy can&#39;t the Fallen have that strength? But no, that strength is not for them, not for Variks. Just this bleeding, sad pragmatism. Just dreg strength. Hanging on.<br/><br/>\nThe alternative is Skolas&#39; strength, fighting together, raging against extinction. Look where that&#39;s gotten the species. The House of Devils&#39; Prime is dead. The House of Winter&#39;s leadership devastated. The poor Exiles trying to claw out some security against the Hive. In the last few years the Fallen have lost so much\u2014and everything is escalating around them. There are gods and powers converging on this system, old machines waking up, old bones whispering flatteries. They need a new way.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Put your mask on,&quot; Petra says. &quot;The Prince gets sullen if he&#39;s kept waiting.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Not like us,&quot; Variks says, oh so mild. The wound on his hand will heal. His work in the Prison of Elders, setting up trial by combat, building an audience and a relationship with the Reef&#39;s scavengers and armories, will bring him a little closer towards rebuilding the House of Judgment. Skolas&#39; fury has guttered out. The Fallen may yet accept peaceful, lawful rule. They may yet survive. They&#39;ll hang on. &quot;We&#39;re very patient, yes?&quot;<br/><br/>\nPetra looks down on him with pity and contempt and a strange fondness.<br/><br/>\nHe puts on his mask.",

Survivor of the great disaster: the day we set out to retake our moon, united in a host of thousands, and found ourselves outmatched by one Hive champion of unspeakable power.<br/><br/>\nThe monster&#39;s name is Crota. He killed my friends face to face, one by one, and he relished it. In the name of all those lost I devote myself to his utter destruction.<br/><br/>\nThis is my confession. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your forgiveness.<br/><br/>\nIn our world Crota seemed invincible. Together Eris Morn and I worked the problem, but found no hope. So we sought forbidden knowledge\u2014the exiled master of Hive arcana.<br/><br/>\nWe found Toland.<br/><br/>\nToland tells us that Crota&#39;s presence in our world is a shadow. That its true power resides in a netherworld forged by his will. We must pass through a keyhole between realities, navigate the seething midnight of Crota&#39;s world-mind, and overthrow the ascendant champions that gather to his throne.<br/><br/>\nToland speaks\u2014he hardly seems mad, at times\u2014of the terrible things that await us. A secret song he hungers to learn, and the issue of that song, an ashen burning star-husk that looms above, the utter antithesis of life. He talks of it with a curious ambition I do not want to understand.<br/><br/>\nTomorrow I will ask Agah, Mota and Tarlowe if they will go with us. If we fail, I leave this record for Guardians to come. Remember us.",

The bolt passes away into nothing. A sword, though, a sword is like a bridge, a crossing-point. The sword binds wielder to victim. It binds life to death. And when the binding is done\u2014the sword remembers. When the Boomer&#39;s fire has burnt away into axion and neutrino scatter, the sword goes on, hungrier and sharper.<br/><br/>\nUnderstand that this nightmare logic underpins His nightmare world, and you will see why the ascendant blade has so much power there. Whenever in our passage we find ourselves in need of power\u2014remember that the greatest authority here is a blade made keen by eons of use.<br/><br/>\nThis is the world the Hive craves: a universe creased by the edge of the sharpest sword.",

Or the Vex may seek to transcend a physical substrate, and move their thoughts directly into the fundament of the universe. <br/><br/>\nIf physics is a set of rules that the cosmos uses to calculate itself, perhaps the Vex seek to worm their way into these calculations: to become a law of reality, inseparable from existence. A virus in the system. Perhaps Atheon was the centerpiece of this project, a command nexus that unified efforts across time.<br/><br/>\nBut we must accept that all of this is speculation.",

The gaunt survivors huddled in these bombed-out ruins spoke of a terrible presence and begged for protection. No self-respecting Guardian could refuse.<br/><br/>\nAs night fell, the Guardians found themselves the hunted - stalked through the ruins by shapes of bone and shadow. The discovery of a Hive Seeder made the truth plain. Mankind&#39;s ancient enemy had come to Earth.<br/><br/>\nThe final confrontation came in the shadow of the Seeder, as a Hive Wizard and her Knights rose to challenge the Guardians. Only one Guardian returned to the City, her knife painted in black ash, a trail of grateful survivors in tow.<br/><br/>\nNow, in the chilling shadows of the Hive&#39;s pods, Guardians hone their skills in hopes that they may one day live up to the heroes of the Rusted Lands.",

Lacking, at the time, the ability to crack Fallen encryptions, the Master of Crows could discern only that the Fallen Houses were all talking to each other. That was a thing that had never happened before.<br/><br/>\nThen the Techeuns looked Earthward\u2014and saw the Fallen there becoming bolder. Tactics suggested they were planning a massive attack. We had no interplanetary arrays\u2014no way to warn Earth. We thought we would be able to do nothing but watch.<br/><br/>\nBut then the Wolves arrived from the Jovians. Their army was hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions strong: a dark wave that washed over the Reef, rushing toward the Earth. As soon as we saw them it was clear that if the Wolves reached Earth, the City would fall.<br/><br/>\nSeemingly oblivious to our existence, the bulk of the Wolf fleet stopped to regroup at Ceres. The Queen&#39;s decision was this: attack the House of Wolves, thereby saving Earth but revealing the Reef&#39;s presence to any and all enemies in the quadrant; or remain silent, preserving the Reef&#39;s invisibility but allowing the City to perish.<br/><br/>\nHer Harbingers ripped into Ceres, destroying the asteroid and killing Virixas, Kell of Wolves and more than half his House. The remaining Wolves scattered, burrowing deep into the Belt for cover. There, new claimants to the Kellship quickly arose: Irxis, Wolf Baroness; Parixas, the Howling; and Skolas, the Rabid.",

Carybdis caught asteroid Tinette in its beam and flung it into Fortuna, destroying both and severely damaging Beltrik&#39;s fleet.

At first, neither side dared to attack the other: on Pallas, Paladin Rife knew that Pirsis had the firepower to destroy the asteroid. Above Pallas, Pirsis held back, hoping to rescue Drevis and Kaliks-4 and the other Wolves that Paladin Rife had captured at the Battle of Bamberga&#39;s Wrath. The Queen sought to diffuse the siege by sending Armada Paladins Abra Zire and Kamala Rior into the Hildian Asteroids, where Skolas was rumored to be hiding, but with the help of his tactician Beltrik, the Veiled, Skolas thwarted them.<br/><br/>\nThe stalemate over Pallas was broken by, of all beings, a dreg. Ironically dubbed Weksis the Meek, the dreg led dozens of followers in an unsanctioned attack on Pallas. They managed to blast a hole in the Athens Hull, but were stopped soon after by Commander Hallam Fen. Weksis and the surviving followers were imprisoned alongside those they had come to save.",

        "cardDescription": "Shame.  Did I ever suffer exhaustion?  Someone asked the question.  Or maybe I asked it of myself.  Then it looked at me.  This moment was real.  I told it what every Exo knows:  \u201cWhat can\u2019t touch you has no strength over you.  And there\u2019s no place for fatigue to latch onto me.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut shame is a different affliction.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019m a soldier.  I was forged by other hands and forced into the role of warrior.  According to my scars, I fought and fought.  Besides bits and flashes, every battle has been forgotten.  But I have this clear, awful sense that others died.  In my unit, every soldier was killed except for me.  Yet despite a thousand chances to be shredded and scrapped, here I stood, no weapon in my hands, making fists out of habit but with nothing to hit.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019d fought to save the Earth.  That was my sense of things.  But our world was collapsing around us, and every soul was doomed.  Even cockroaches and microbes would die.  And being an expert in the art of losing battles, I saw no ending to this battle but another loss.<br/><br/>\nAnd I was ashamed.<br/><br/>\nThe shame took hold of me.  It shook me.  Shame stole my mass and my resolve.  Suddenly I felt like a feather, like a breath, like any small nothing ready to be lost in the first breeze.<br/><br/>\nBut in the midst of that despair, a fresh thought took hold.<br/><br/>\nI was cursed.<br/><br/>\nAnd do you know what a curse is?<br/><br/>\nIt is stubborn.  A curse delivered by the gods will hold you when everything else has given up on you.  And it was obvious that survival was my eternal curse.  A thousand battles and how many were won?  Judging by the evidence, none.  And that\u2019s why the shame was chewing at my ceramic guts.  But despite the horrific losses, I had endured.<br/><br/>\nClosing my eyes, I forced my fists to open.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d I said.  To this enemy, to myself.  To the wind threatening to carry me away.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThis war isn\u2019t done with me.\u201d",

Tracking Fallen, after the bandits had caused a stir.<br/><br/>\nThe stranger \u2013 the other \u2013 arrived the following day.<br/><br/>\nHe rarely spoke. Took a room. Took our hospitality.<br/><br/>\nI was intrigued by him, as I was Jaren when he\u2019d first arrived.<br/><br/>\nBut the stranger was cold. Distant. Damaged, I thought.<br/><br/>\nBut I wasn\u2019t afraid. Not yet.<br/><br/>\nOnly a child, I knew the monsters of our world to walk like men, but they were not. They were something alien. Four-armed and savage.<br/><br/>\nThe stranger was polite, but solemn.<br/><br/>\nI took him for a sad, broken man, and he was. Though, at the time, I didn\u2019t understand how that could make one dangerous.<br/><br/>\nAs with Jaren, father made an effort to keep me away from the stranger.<br/><br/>\nIt wouldn\u2019t matter.<br/><br/>\nAs the silhouette approached, fear held tight.<br/><br/>\nThe dark figure towered over me. Looking into me \u2013 through me.<br/><br/>\nHe smiled. My knees weak. All lost.<br/><br/>\nThen, he turned and walked away.<br/><br/>\nLeaving ruin and a heartbroken, terrified boy in his wake without a second glance.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019ve been chasing that stranger\u2019s shadow ever since.<br/><br/><br/><i>Now.</i><br/><br/>\nWe stood silent, the sun high.<br/><br/>\nSeconds passed, feeling more like hours.<br/><br/>\nHe looked different.<br/><br/>\nHe seemed, now, to be weightless \u2013 effortless in an existence that would crush a man burdened by conscience.<br/><br/>\nMy gaze remained locked as I felt a heat rising inside of me.<br/>\nThe other spoke...<br/><br/>\n\u201cBeen awhile.\u201d<br/><br/>\nI gave no reply.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe gunslinger\u2019s sword... his cannon. That was a gift.\u201d<br/><br/>\nMy silence held as my thumb caressed the perfectly worn hammer at my hip.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAn offering from me... to you.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe heat grew. Centered in my chest.<br/><br/>\nI felt like a coward the day Jaren Ward died and for many cycles after.<br/><br/>\nBut here, I felt only the fire of my Light.<br/><br/>\nThe other probed...<br/><br/>\n\u201cNothing to say?\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe let the words hang.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you. For this day.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHis attempt at conversation felt mundane when judged against all that had come before.<br/><br/>\n\u201cMany times I thought you\u2019d faltered. Given up...\u201d<br/><br/>\nAll I\u2019d lost, all who\u2019d suffered, flashed rapid through my mind, intercut with a dark silhouette walking toward a frightened, weak, coward of a boy.<br/><br/>\nThe fire burned in me.<br/><br/>\nThe other continued...<br/><br/>\n\u201cBut here you are. This is truly an end...\u201d<br/><br/>\nAs his tongue slipped between syllables my gun hand moved as if of its own will.<br/><br/>\nReflex and purpose merged with anger, clarity and an overwhelming need for just that... an end.<br/><br/>\nIn step with my motion, the fire within burst into focus \u2013 through my shoulder, down my arm \u2013 as my finger closed on the trigger of my third father\u2019s cannon.<br/><br/>\nTwo shots. Two bullets engulfed in an angry glow. <br/>\nThe other fell.<br/><br/>\nI walked to his corpse. He never raised his cursed Thorn \u2013 the jagged gun with the festering sickness.<br/><br/>\nI looked down at the dead man who had caused so much death.<br/><br/>\nMy shooter still embraced by the dancing flames of my Light.<br/>\nA sadness came over me.<br/><br/>\nI thought back to my earliest days. Of Palamon. Of Jaren.<br/><br/>\nLeveling my cannon at the dead man\u2019s helm, I paid one final tribute to my mentor, my savior, my father and my friend...<br/><br/>\n\u201cYours... Not mine.\u201d<br/><br/>\n...as I closed my grip, allowing Jaren\u2019s cannon, now my own, to have the last, loud word.",

Willbreaker demands a subjugation more diffuse than the simple snick and smash of a physical brink. It does not have to touch you to wound you.<br/><br/>\nAnd lastly\u2014and this is critical: To be taken in Willbreaker&#39;s grasp is to know true bliss; that is, to be simplified; that is, to be reduced to one&#39;s most basic level, shedding all higher-order thoughts of fear or duty or selfishness; that is, to feel only pain.<br/><br/>\nNow do you see?

He tried to retract the shield, but it was locked to its initiation time.  He couldn\u2019t remember activating it.  Then he remembered the battle.  That blast.<br/><br/>\nWhat that ship fired was ancient, not bound to anything the Origin Libraries even sought to describe.<br/><br/>\nHe tried to calm down.  He thought of her, searching for her pull.  He couldn\u2019t find it, but he was not calm.  She always told him she would always be there behind the calm.<br/><br/>\nAll he could hear were echoes of that sound.<br/><br/>\nIt began as soon as they hit the ring plane, ringing in the old glimmer of his long-buried self.  Before she showed him who he was\u2014in the before and the after.<br/><br/>\nThe Techeuns should\u2019ve known what the Dreadnaught could do.  Must\u2019ve known.  Did they not feel what he felt?  Hear what he heard?  And that damn Ketch, it wasn\u2019t protected.  They had to know that.  All to deploy the Harbingers.  They barely got a foothold before the weapon was fired.  He thought of Petra and how overwhelmed she must be, forced to hold her post, and watch her people perish.<br/><br/>\nHe tried to calm himself again, forcing long breaths.  He realized where he was: Mars. Athabasca. The Candor Isles.  He hadn\u2019t been here in so long, not since he found the Black Garden.<br/><br/>\nThe countdown to the shield\u2019s deactivation pulsed.  He tried again, to home in on her, to find if she truly gave herself for this battle.  He felt close to something, a hum of starlight, then shield deactivation broke his focus.<br/><br/>\nHe climbed out and saw the damage to his ship, and the truths of the armada&#39;s devastation sunk in.<br/><br/>\nHe turned in despair to find hundreds of his Crow drones, deployed on Mars long ago, circling his ship, waiting.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWelcome back, Master.\u201d The one closest to him spoke first, and the others followed, a wave of salutations echoed throughout the dry sea.<br/><br/>\nAnd with that hope returned.<br/><br/>\n\u201cBegin repairs on the ship immediately.

So that\u2019s it, we are done now?\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe removed his helm, tossed it aside, and dropped to his knees.<br/><br/>\nThe Devils without a Kell. This war was over, at last.

You must never forget.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI cannot.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Ghost killed the feed and waited for its Guardian\u2019s words.<br/>\n\u201cGhost, prepare my Vex arsenal and plot a course for Mercury.

Harsh light from an unfamiliar sun backlights the four-armed creature, making it impossible to see its face.  Its massive head turns, and a clicking and chittering voice can be heard speaking to something off-screen.  While the noises themselves are harsh, the tone and content seem almost gentle.  A curious creature, not a violent or angry one.<br/><br/>\nThe lens refocuses beyond the creature&#39;s head as it talks, and a startling landscape climbs to the horizon.  It&#39;s a paradise.  Carefully tended lakes and rivers, water everywhere, wind their way between fields of lush iridescent crops and into groves of starkly colored trees.  Every inch of the land seems engineered, brushed by a sculptor&#39;s hand for form and function both.<br/><br/>\nThe sky is a light pink, spotted with clouds and crowded with ships.  Thick lanes of aerial traffic soar through the air, tightly managed and seemingly endless.<br/><br/>\nAnd beyond it all, above the clouds, hangs a perfect alabaster sphere.  The image wobbles, shaking, flickering as if the Ghost is blinking. And the fragment ends.",

The result is a series of tableaus, moments in time captured by the Ghost&#39;s struggle to see what&#39;s going on:<br/><br/>\n- The face of an Exo, staring impassively down at the Ghost from very close.  He appears to be confused, unsure what he is looking at.<br/><br/>\n- A landscape, from a position a few feet off the ground, moving laterally to the point of view.  The Ghost appears to be clipped to the Exo&#39;s belt.  The image is of a battlefield, and over two dozen Exo soldiers can be seen marshalling for battle.<br/><br/>\n- A chaotic scene of Vex and Exos fighting a titanic battle.  The backdrop is a pitted and scarred landscape, a planet unidentifiable from present context.  Vex energy bolts hang in midair as the frames click by, teeming masses of constructs surging towards an entrenched line of Exo soldiers.<br/><br/>\n- A metallic leg and boot, belonging to a Vex Goblin.  The Exo goes down.<br/><br/>\n- The horizon of this battle-scarred world, the Ghost kicked free of the Exo&#39;s body.  Most details are obscured by dark and shadow, but one detail is easily made out: a massive crashed spacecraft.  The last image: a sigil of Golden Age Earth, emblazoned on the side of the ship&#39;s prow.",

Hours of this before, with a wash of power, a huge convoy of ships drops into reality from warp.<br/><br/>\nA convoy of Guardian craft, hundreds strong.  Ships of all sizes and shapes can be seen, from venerable craft that have been salvaged from the Golden Age through to City designs to  vessels that have yet to emerge from the Shipwright&#39;s hangars.<br/><br/>\nThe ships are battle-scarred.  Many are barely spaceworthy.  As warp drives wind down several seem to lose power and begin to drift.  Some of the largest craft bear imagery familiar to frequent visitors to the tower: Dead Orbit symbols, the simple icon of the Vanguard.  The New Monarchy and Future War Cult as well, though fewer examples can be seen.  Others bears symbols never seen in the Tower to date.<br/><br/>\nEvery single ship, from the largest cruiser to the smallest personal craft, carries shards of stone, remnants of the City and the Tower.  Banners too, tattered and worn from entering and leaving warp.<br/><br/>\nThe fleet is only visible for a few breaths, less than a minute.  Then, with a massive flash of light, the fleet jumps on.  The craft that have lost power are left behind, spinning and whirling away from the etheric wake of their powered fellows.  The Ghost spins on, and soon enough only stars fill its field of view until the fragment ends.",

And another few years to get it transmitting.  Now, in the brief windows of time when the door to his cell opened, he would call for help.  He sighed, a deliberate act that caused him to cough roughly. He had no idea how much longer his body would hold out.  But then, that kind of thinking was all relative here, wasn&#39;t it?<br/><br/>\nPraedyth stared at the sprawling mass of metal and wires, listening to the tinny sounds coming from his makeshift speaker.  Before he spoke, he always made a point to listen.  The words, the concepts that flowed into his mind confused him.  Timelines and potentialities that might have already happened, might happen, might never happen.<br/><br/>\nA pattern was ever dancing in the edge of his vision.  At times like this, when the world rushed past him, he had to hold tight to the fact that he was still breathing.  He would often focus in on the intake, output, inbreath, outbreath, breath, breath, breath... hours later, he blinked.  Refocused.  The static had stopped. He had missed a window.<br/><br/>\nOnce, he would have cursed and spat.  Now, he just shook his head.  A weak movement of the neck.<br/><br/>\nThe Vex had decided their end.  The Guardians had interceded.  The Vex were fallible.<br/><br/>\nIf the Vex can be wrong... if they can make mistakes... someday he could be free.  Someday he might leave the Vault, might see again the Traveler.<br/><br/>\nUntil then he would listen, he would observe.  He would be the man on the outside looking in, a viewpoint into the consciousness of Minds that spanned galaxies.  He would try to understand the Vex.<br/><br/>\nPraedyth closed his eyes.",

Massive Hive warship sighted in circum-Saturn space [contact via DSR TF 3.2]. Target designated DREADNAUGHT.<br/><br/>\n1a. Dreadnaught maneuvering unpredictably. Orbital parameters and stationkeeping behavior not compatible with standard dynamics.<br/><br/>\n1b. ESM analysis detects multiple Hive vessels in escort.<br/><br/>\n2. Target emitting sterile neutrinos, phaeton spectra, and mass growl. Major radiation events include gravity waves and axion scatter. Techeun conclusion: target possesses radical ontomorphic capabilities [see BANE DREAMER]<br/><br/>\n2a. Under no circumstances attempt teleonomic analysis of Dreadnaught emission spectra. ***This is a BRAINSTAIN ALERT.***<br/><br/>\n3. Dreadnaught radiation events correlate with eversive breach events across solar system. Dreadnaught is likely motive force behind breach events.<br/><br/>\n3b. Backscatter analysis and Techeun insight suggest Dreadnaught hosts complex internal environment. Small party boarding action may remain viable if noopathic hazards can be managed.<br/><br/>\n4.

Why? Because He is all in the action, fellow traveler, His philosophy is all on display. He has twinned himself so closely to the power He admires. He has become many-placed, many-formed, sending out emissaries of himself to ask after the truth.<br/><br/>\nIn each act of His power Oryx seeks to incarnate the self-sustaining, immortal suzerainty that He worships. The power that He uses to wash his Taken clean and etch them into useful shapes.<br/><br/>\nLISTEN! LISTEN! Understand, you simpleton, it\u2019s <i>entirely obvious</i> \u2014<br/><br/>\nOryx inhabits a world where power is truth. To win is to be noble, and to be real. When He departs from that world, out into the material universe, He is lessened.<br/><br/>\nThe echoes of Oryx go forth to ask a question: are you the truth? And that means \u2014 well.

He has predicated Himself on it, He has pursued across thousands of cairn worlds His quest to embody it, and you have seen the force of that truth expended to create these Taken.<br/><br/>\nHe is not a simple thing to kill. He wants to be isomorphic to conquest, to triumph, to killing and death. He is a syllogism, now, but in time He hopes to become an axiom.<br/><br/>\nThis is His strength and His fatal weakness.<br/><br/>\nFor if he ever falters in His performance, if the inflow of devastation ever falls behind His expenditure of ruin, He will be consumed. If He is ever outmatched, then by the terms of His own existence, He will cease.<br/><br/>\nIt is to Oryx Himself, in the heart of the Dreadnaught that armors and encapsulates his throne-world, that you must make your last and surest argument.<br/><br/>\nGood luck!

Artillery shrieks overhead. On the plains below the Cabal perimeter, Vex march out of the lightning. Torch hammers burst up like mortars and Ta\u2019aun and his bond brother duck behind a burning Interceptor for cover.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThis is going well,\u201d Tlu\u2019urn rumbles.<br/><br/>\nA Vex particle beam needles a little hole through the Centurion\u2019s helmet. He falls dead. Goblins swarm over her bunker and then the Goliath tank supporting this bastion fires a main gun round into the mess, killing the Vex, the bunker, and all the Legionaries inside. The concussion knocks Tlu\u2019urn against his Primus.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAbout as well as expected,\u201d Ta\u2019aun grunts. Tlu\u2019urn laughs.<br/><br/>\nThe grind is eternal. Like duty. Ta\u2019aun keeps fighting, out here past the edge of the Empire, because failure is unthinkable. Defeat\u2019s much worse than death.<br/><br/>\nBut Ta\u2019aun is so, so tired.<br/><br/>\nTlu\u2019urn gets up and starts shooting Vex. \u201cYou\u2019re not really going to do it.\u201d Even though he\u2019s fully armored, and only a meter away, his voice on the com crashes with static. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to go. It\u2019s mad.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Vex Hobgoblins start firing at Tlu\u2019urn.<br/><br/>\nParticle beams scream and spark off his enormous bulk. Ta\u2019aun yanks him back to cover. A maniple of Phalanx troops rush forward to plug the gap. \u201cI have my orders. Our report went all the way up, and the decision came all the way back.\u201d<br/><br/>\nValus Tlu\u2019urn\u2019s blank helmet swivels to stare. \u201cYou mean \u2014 ?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt came from the Emperor Himself.\u201d Ta\u2019aun can feel the pressure gel pumping against his skin, keeping him insulated from this deadly world, keeping him alive. \u201cI\u2019m ordered to board and capture the Hive flagship. At any cost.\u201d<br/><br/>\nA Vex Minotaur blinks up behind the Phalanx line. Primus Ta\u2019aun\u2019s armor paints the target and he absolutely unloads, putting all his fear and anger and sorrow into the wretched machine. He roars and roars. The Minotaur burns.<br/><br/>\nHis soldiers cheer.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s a job for an elite unit. Not a few scout legions bogged down in attrition war. We should wait until \u2014 \u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s the mission I\u2019ve been given. I will use what I have.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cMutiny,\u201d Tlu\u2019urn whispers. \u201cYou should mutiny.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOh, to mutiny. To be like Valus Trau\u2019ug, who took his Broken Legion against the Reef \u2014 and failed, failed utterly.<br/><br/>\nDuty is victory. Mutiny is worse than death. Even if death seems certain.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ta\u2019aun says. And that\u2019s that.<br/><br/>\nThe Vex are falling back. Together, they\u2019ve held the line.",

It represents many hundreds of failed operations.<br/><br/>\nGuardian activity in the Freehold AO has exploded across recent campaign seasons. Tactical attrition exceeds both frictional projections and our ability to regenerate losses. New tactics are necessary.    <br/><br/>\nThe primary threat is the Guardians\u2019 individual counter-attrition capability. <br/><br/>\nGuardians can be rebuilt after even total disintegrative trauma. This capability is provided by a small autonomous drone unit called a Dead Person [trans. unclear]. The Dead Person conceals itself during combat. It is not a viable target for direct fire. Saturation attack by artillery/heavy air/orbital fire may have good effect (although Guardians transmat frequently and refuse to assemble into large formations).<br/><br/>\nSolitary Dead Persons have been observed in all areas of operation. The relationship between solitary and paired Dead Persons remains unclear.<br/><br/>\nPsion analysis indicates that specific areas are inimicable to Guardian counter-attritional reconstruction. Phobos Command has initiated an orbital survey. BL I/2 will attack the Vex gate artifact in Meridian Bay to secure possible related intelligence.<br/><br/>\nFlayer analysis suggests that the Hive have developed unconventional counter-Dead Person capability. The capture of Hive leadership might yield vital strategic intelligence, including weapons or tactics capable of defeating Guardians permanently.<br/><br/>\nWe advance that the Hive fleet group near Saturn presents a strong target.<br/><br/>\nFor the Primus,<br/>\nOur highest duty done,<br/>\nUnflinchingly loyal,<br/>\nSkyburner V/A/SI",

All the other nearby continents \u2014 the Helium Drinkers, the Bone Plaza, the Starcutters \u2014 came from the same world.<br/><br/>\nPerhaps the other races of the Fundament are migrants too.<br/><br/>\nWe live on the shrapnel of our homeworld, floating on an ocean deep inside a gas giant.<br/><br/>\nThat\u2019s what Fundament must be. A titanic gas planet. The endless storm above us must be one layer of the atmosphere. And the sea we float on... there\u2019s more down beneath it. So much more!<br/><br/>\nYou understand what this means, Sathona. The Timid Truth is a lie. We aren\u2019t meant to be the world\u2019s prey. We weren\u2019t born to live and die in the dark.<br/><br/>\nWe have a better destiny.<br/><br/>\nTell our father, sister Sathona.

I failed to anticipate some strategy, some nemesis. (Perhaps Taox, if she still lives.)<br/><br/>\nIf I am defeated, I know that I will fall to something mighty. Something that craves might, something that loves what I love, which is the Deep, a principle and a power, the versatile, protean need to adapt and endure, to reach out and shape the universe entirely for that purpose, to mutate and redesign and test and iterate so that it can prevail, can seize existence and hold it, certain that this is everything, that there is nothing to life except living. And it has two faces, yet it is one shape. One face is the objective, which is obvious, and the other face is that will to sacrifice things and ideas for a single mission, the mission of becoming the shape, a shape that will not relent, the utter commitment to survival, to draw the right sword and choose where to cut: to allow this hunger to become your weapon.<br/><br/>\nSo I will prepare a book, which is a map to a weapon. And my vanquisher will read that book, seeking the weapon, and they will come to understand me, where I have been and where I was going. And then they will take up my weapon, and they will use it, they will use that weapon, which is all that I am.<br/><br/>\nAnd armed thus with my past, and my future, and my present (which is a weapon, a weapon that takes whatever is available, a weapon bound to malice), they will mantle me, Oryx, the Taken King.<br/><br/>\nThey will become me and I will become them, each of us defeating the other, correcting the other, alloying ourselves into one omnipotent philosophy. Thus I will live forever.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019ll make sure.",

A stormjoy is a living cloud. When it passes over our continent, it lowers its feeding tentacles. On each tentacle are the BAIT STARS. Although light makes you happy, you must avoid it. You will be eaten.<br/><br/>\nA stormjoy is a good way for an old person to choose death. Also, a daring knight can cut the bait stars from the tentacles. I have six!<br/><br/>\nFALLING.

The currents of the Fundament Ocean bring us near other continents. The Helium Court is near us now. They are of our species, but they are our enemies. Their knights raid us every day. Helium Drinkers have two legs, two arms, and three eyes, just like us. But they are bright/evil. I want to be a knight and fight them!<br/><br/>\nThe Helium Drinker ambassador ate ten of my sisters as tribute. This is normal. However, I resent it.<br/><br/>\nMOTHERS. Mothers can fly! They live much longer than ten years. Mothers are extremely smart, and they guard their spawn. If you try to tamper with the eggs, they will eat you. Sathona wants to eat the jelly and become a mother when she turns four.<br/><br/>\nSTORMS. The rain is often poisonous. Sometimes it dissolves flesh. When lightning misses the lightning farm, it can vaporize a person. <br/><br/>\nThis entire world is deadly to us. <br/><br/>\nMYSTERIES. The Fundament is very large. We are the smallest things in it. If you don\u2019t understand something, it will probably kill you. My teacher Taox says this is why we have such short lives. So we can breed and adapt quickly.<br/><br/>\nMOON WAVES. My sister Aurash is afraid of moon waves. When she gets back from her expedition to the Tungsten Monoliths, I will ask her why.",

As a neuter, I can rise above the small battles of court politics.<br/><br/>\nI alone see the patterns of survival. Alone I designed the great engines that move the Osmium Court. Now \u2014<br/><br/>\nAlone I must act to save my kingdom.<br/><br/>\nSenility has claimed my lord the Osmium King. He is ten, and mad. The study of ancient text consumes him. Today he raves about moons above the storm. Tomorrow he will wander the halls, speaking to his familiar, a dead white worm from the deep sea. He keeps it in glass, and he tends to it, and he neglects the duties of a king.<br/><br/>\nThe Osmium King has three surviving heirs, each two years old:<br/><br/>\nXi Ro, the youngest and bravest, who wants to be a knight.<br/><br/>\nSathona, most clever, who wants to be a mother.<br/><br/>\nAurash, navigator child, who dreams of the infinite ocean. Tomorrow she will return from the Tungsten Monoliths.<br/><br/>\nNone of these are suitable heirs. None of them will protect the Osmium Court from the howling Fundament. Xi Ro can fight, but not lead. Sathona can think, but not fight. Aurash\u2019s curiosity will draw her away from duty. I fear for all future children.<br/><br/>\nSoon the Osmium King will lock himself into the Royal Orrery to study the moons. Gather your knights, o Helium Drinkers, and invade our continent. Kill the three heirs. I will rule the Osmium Court as your regent, and build engines for you.<br/><br/>\nAnd if I fail, let the Leviathan in the deep eat me.<br/><br/>\nWritten in grief,<br/>\nThis hateful request,<br/>\nTaox, Osmium-mother, neutered to watch",

Only Sathona\u2019s tricks let us reach the coast. But now that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am the navigator.<br/><br/>\nWe may never see our homes again. Xi Ro seethes with hate and fury for Taox.<br/><br/>\nBut this is my deepest fear \u2014<br/><br/>\nOur civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thousands of other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move us all.<br/><br/>\nThe Timid Truth says that we are the smallest, most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the universe. Taox would have us believe that our ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the hungry void.<br/><br/>\nMy father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to me \u2014<br/><br/>\n\u201cAurash, my first daughter! The moons are different! The laws are bent!\u201d<br/><br/>\nAnd he made the sign of a syzygy.<br/><br/>\nImagine the fifty-two moons of Fundament lining up in the sky. (It wouldn\u2019t take all fifty-two, of course: just a few massive moons. But this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a swollen bulge...<br/><br/>\nImagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy passed. A wave big enough to swallow civilizations. A God-Wave.<br/><br/>\nI have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-Wave annihilates my species. If I could only get back into my father\u2019s orrery, I could learn exactly when!<br/><br/>\nWe are weeks of travel and many continents away from home.<br/><br/>\nWhen I\u2019m paralyzed by fear, Xi Ro sits in the cabin with me and comforts me with soft, brave words. But more and more we have come to rely on Sathona\u2019s wit. She will go off to be alone (she insists she must be alone) and return with some mad idea \u2014 steer into the storm, throw down a net, eat that strange beast, explore that menacing wreck.<br/><br/>\nSomehow Sathona seems to manufacture good luck by sheer will.",

This year of wild voyaging, these lightning nights and golden days, these forays into ancient wrecks and windblown flights from monsters: these are the happiest times of my life.<br/><br/>\n  2. I want to be a mother not because I want to spawn but because I want a long life. Long enough to make a difference. We have been at sea a year and I am afraid, afraid we will die out here.<br/><br/>\n  3. I know where to find secrets. I know where vast slow things with long memories live.<br/><br/>\n  4. The needle ship...<br/><br/>\nThe needle ship \u2014<br/>\nCarved in my code by Sathona \u2014<br/>\nA liar \u2014<br/><br/>\n  1. We salvaged the needle from the Shvubi Maelstrom. I knew it would be there.<br/><br/>\n  2. The needle is a gray ship, as long and slender as hope, as unbreakable as time, and old. Older than death. It tumbled through the maelstrom before our ancestors crashed into the Fundament. This is not a sea-ship, like Aurash\u2019s. It is an artifact of high technology.<br/><br/>\n  3. I know its purpose. I know what happened to the crew.<br/><br/>\n  4. Xi Ro wants to sell the ship at Kaharn Atoll, where species gather. At auction, it would earn us enough wealth to hire mercenaries. We could retake our Osmium Court and send the baby-eating Helium Drinkers screaming into the ocean \u2014<br/><br/>\n  5. \u2014 but I told Xi Ro the ship was worthless.<br/><br/>\n  6. Aurash wants to open the ship and see if we can take command of it. I know this is the right thing to do. I know because I asked the worm...<br/><br/>\nThe worm \u2014<br/>\nCarved in my code by Sathona \u2014<br/>\nWho should be afraid \u2014<br/><br/>\n  1. It was my father\u2019s familiar. I ripped it from him as we fled. It is a dead white thing, segmented, washed up from the deep sea.<br/><br/>\n  2. It\u2019s dead, but it still speaks to me. It says: listen closely, oh vengeance mine...",

Come. Steer the ship for a while. Take joy in what our needle can do.\u201d<br/><br/>\nXi Ro tried to protest, but secretly, she was so glad for Aurash\u2019s care. She flew the needle ship in cutting circles, down beneath the sea: and their wake rose up to the surface like a traitor\u2019s dying breath.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAurash, lonely navigator, we have traveled so long with only each other. I know you love to hear and speak new tongues. Come, sit in the flesh garden room. I will read you these stories I bought at Kaharn.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAurash sat among the mummified flesh fans with two of her eyes closed and listened in silence to Sathona\u2019s stories, hungry to understand, voracious to know as much as she could before her ten year life died.<br/><br/>\nLater, Xi Ro said, \u201cSathona, cutting mind of ours, you grow lonely in your thought. Play swords and lanterns with me!\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut Sathona was heavy with sorrow, and couldn\u2019t pretend any joy as she chased Xi Ro through the needle\u2019s glistening halls.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSathona, pensive one, what is it? What troubles you?\u201d<br/><br/>\nHer sisters listened as Sathona said \u201cOath-bearing siblings, we are five years old. For two years we\u2019ve worked to repair this ancient ship and understand its systems. I am almost too old for the mother jelly, and the knights who killed our father are surely dying of age.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe three will die here, in exile. Taox will outlive us. And Aurash, brilliant-eyed Aurash, you will die of old age long before you have proof of your God-Wave, or any way to stop it.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAurash and Xi Ro looked at each other. \u201cI wish you weren\u2019t so honest,\u201d Xi Ro said. And Aurash thought that Sathona had never been wrong.<br/><br/>\nIn her soul Aurash knew that the only way to keep their oath was to find a great, powerful secret. A secret that could change everything. This was Aurash\u2019s soul, her fire and her shadow \u2014 her desire to cut through the flank of the world and find its beating heart.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe have to dive,\u201d Aurash said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this ship is built to do. Dive into the Fundament, the world below us... towards the core.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the ancient crew died so obscenely,\u201d Xi Ro protested. \u201cThat\u2019s where the atrocity in the birthing room was born...\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe have to dive,\u201d Sathona said, following the whispers of her familiar. \u201cIn the world beneath us, in the metallic depths, I hope we may find what we need most...\u201d<br/><br/>\nMore time.

Do you thrill at the secret, Savath&#251;n? Do you relish the edge of this truth, Xivu Arath?  Do you see the beautiful shape?<br/><br/>\nThe Ammonite occupied a piece of reality.

Saying: \u2018we are peaceful and good, we harm nothing.\u2019<br/><br/>\nTheir golden age was a cancer.<br/><br/>\nThey did nothing to advance the cause of life! They burnt up time and matter and thought on this solipsistic, onanistic pursuit of safety, insulating themselves from death, making a regressive pocket of useless stability. When they could have helped whittle the universe towards its final, perfect form!<br/><br/>\nAnd your people, suffering in the Deep, you became more worthy of existence than the Ammonite. You have proven it.<br/><br/>\nLook around the sky. Behold the great divide, the battle lines of the cosmic war. We are the Worm your God, but we are not the Deep Itself. We only move within it. You shall too. You shall venerate and study it and haunt it in its passage.<br/><br/>\nWill you lift your thoughts to the millennia, Auryx? Will you bend your will to the liberation of the universe, and join us in the war against the Sky?<br/><br/>\nWe need champions. Crusaders. Help us save the universe. Help us exterminate that which would destroy all hope. You are oathbound to this task, by the covenant of the worm.<br/><br/>\nAnd you are oathbound to kill Taox.

Instead, take vengeance upon me for what I did at the dry moon! And AURYX made war on her, in worship of the Deep. Between them stood XIVU ARATH saying, stop, or I will kill you, war is mine and I am strongest.<br/><br/>\nThis was how they worshipped.<br/><br/>\nFor twenty thousand years they fought across the moons and they fought in the abyssal plains and lightning palaces of each other&#39;s sword spaces. And they killed each other again and again, so that they could practice death.<br/><br/>\nSuch was their love.<br/><br/>\nAt last the many moons came to many worlds and it was time to go to war on life. AURYX said, I shall establish a court, and whoever comes into this court may challenge me. My court will be the High War. It will be a killing ground and a school of the sword logic we have learned from our gods.<br/><br/>\nSAVATH&#219;N thought this was a great idea. She made a court called the High Coven. XIVU ARATH said, the world is my court, wherever there is war.",

        "cardDescription": "I killed my sister today.<br/><br/>\nShe came to this star to oversee the extermination of all life here. The Qugu are a strong power, and their fleets protect four nearby stars. As herd animals they are loyal and stubborn. But they do show grace.<br/><br/>\nFor millions of years of evolution the Qugu have been infected by a virus so insidious that it wrote itself into their genome. The virus compels them to offer their limbs for amputation by enormous sessile jaw-beasts. They venerate these beasts and treat them as gods. The virus converts Qugu cells into eggs, from which strange crawling things pupate, to live within the jaw-beast gut. In turn the jaw-beast extrudes sweet nectar for the Qugu to drink, and they have brilliant visions.<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n and her broods have liberated the Qugu from jaw-beasts, and indeed from existence. But as they chased the Qugu ark-ships, I stopped in to vaporize my sister\u2019s warship and a few of her underlings. I want to dwell on the ruins a while, and punish Savath&#251;n for failing to guard her flank.<br/><br/>\nThey are like us, these Qugu. Bound in symbiosis.<br/><br/>\nI feel joy, and sorrow. I feel them as titanic things, because I am larger than my body, my mind is now a cosmos of its own. I know more joy and more anguish than the entire Qugu race could ever experience.<br/><br/>\nSorrow, because we have killed so much (eighteen species this century alone), and joy for the same reason. Joy that we have put down these blights. Scoured them away and left the universe clean, ready to move towards its final shape. We are a wind of progress. Ripping parasites from the material world \u2014 for if they were not parasites, we would be unable to kill them, and they would still exist. <br/><br/>\nAnd what is that final shape? It is a fire without fuel, burning forever, killing death, asking a question that is its own answer, entirely itself. That is what we must become.<br/><br/>\nMy worm grows fat and hungry. I feed it with whole worlds. My astronomers tell me they can sense the Deep Itself, and that we are conquering our way towards it.<br/><br/>\nI think joy and sorrow will be the same thing soon.

They are huge, huge, and they burn with furious power. But this embrace is weakness and we despise it.<br/><br/>\nNever before have we despised our lords. Have they failed us? We the Hive have been driven back, world by world.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI am at my end,\u201d Savath&#251;n says. \u201cI plot and plan. But I cannot gather enough bloodshed to feed my worm. And the harder I try, the hungrier it becomes.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI slaughter and kill,\u201d Xivu Arath says, \u201cbut the harder I fight, the more my worm demands. I too am at my end.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe Ecumene war angels have killed me so many times,\u201d Auryx says, \u201cthat I dare not go out into the universe, lest I need my might to protect myself. My worm chews at my soul in hunger.\u201d<br/><br/>\nIs this the end of our crusade? Are we the Hive unworthy to exist?<br/><br/>\nXivu Arath puts down her great head. \u201cWe should retire and gather our strength.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n closes her eyes in puzzled defeat. \u201cWe should beg the Worm our God to tell us what to do.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut King Auryx, who knows best the beauty of the final shape, roars at them. \u201cHave you learned nothing? Would you deny our purpose? Whatever we do, we will do by killing, by an act of war and might. That is the final arbiter we serve, that violent arbiter, and if we turn away from it we deserve to be eaten. No! We must obey our natures. We must be long-sighted, and cunning, and strong. We must take this gift the Worm our God has given us, this challenge, and find a way to keep existing!\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHow will we feed our worms?\u201d Xivu Arath asks.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI know,\u201d says cunning Savath&#251;n. \u201cI know a way. But it won\u2019t work unless we are killing the Ecumene by the billions.  How can we beat them?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIf we cannot beat their strengths,\u201d says Xivu Arath, \u201cwe must infect their weaknesses. But they are lords of matter and physical law.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI know a way,\u201d King Auryx says. \u201cBut it will require great power. More power than any one of us can claim.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThen kill me,\u201d says Xivu Arath, \u201cand use that killing logic, the power you prove by killing something as mighty as me.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSo King Auryx took up his blade and beheaded Xivu Arath.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAnd strangle me,\u201d says Savath&#251;n, holding a blade behind her back. \u201cUse that killing logic, the cunning you prove by killing something as smart as me.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut King Auryx turned with the speed and might of Xivu Arath, and beheaded Savath&#251;n before she could move. King Auryx was the First Navigator, with the map of death.<br/><br/>\nThese were true deaths, for they happened in the sword world.<br/><br/>\nThen he went to the Worm named Akka.",

I have come to receive a secret. I want the secret power of the Deep, which you hold.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI give no secrets,\u201d said Akka, whose voice was code.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Auryx, \u201cyou give nothing. Giving is for the Sky. You worship the Deep, which asks that we take what we need.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAkka said nothing, because if it denied this truth, the truth might become false.<br/><br/>\n \u201cBut you gave us your larvae, the worm,\u201d said Auryx, \u201cand that is why the worm devours us now: because it was given, not taken. So I must take what I need from you, although you are my god.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSaid Akka, \u201cYou have not the strength.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut this was a lie. Auryx had killed Savath&#251;n his sibling and Xivu Arath his sibling, and he had the sword logic of killing them.<br/><br/>\nAuryx the First Navigator set upon his god with his sword and his words, and cut Akka to pieces, and took from those pieces the secret of calling upon the Deep. He wrote this secret on a set of tablets, which he called the Tablets of Ruin. And he wore them about his waist.<br/><br/>\nThen Auryx said, \u201cNow I may speak to the Deep, the beautiful final shape. I will be King of Shapes. I will learn all the secrets of our destiny.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHis speech to the Deep is not recorded here. But it is known that he returned, and he said, now I am Oryx, the Taken King.

At the end of those hundred years he killed the Ecumene Council on the Fractal Wreath, and from their blood rose Xivu Arath, saying, \u201cI am war, and you have conjured me back with war.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx was glad, for he loved Xivu Arath. The Ecumene wailed in grief.<br/><br/>\nThen Oryx and Xivu Arath made war on the Ecumene for forty years. At the end of those forty years Oryx said to the Dakaua Nest, listen, I am jealous of my sibling Xivu Arath, help me kill her. And in desperation they agreed.<br/><br/>\nBut he drove the Dakaua Nest into a trap, and they were made extinct. From their ashes rose cunning Savath&#251;n, saying, \u201cI am trickery, and you have conjured me back with trickery.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx was glad, for he loved Savath&#251;n. The Ecumene fled into the void.<br/><br/>\nThen they made war on the Ecumene for a thousand years, and exterminated them so wholly that nowhere except in this book are they remembered. This book and the mind of Taox, who was not found.<br/><br/>\nAnd Savath&#251;n said, \u201cKing Oryx, how will we feed our worms? Did you use my plan?\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx told the Hive: I am the Taken King, and here is my law.<br/><br/>\nYou Thrall, each of you will claw and scream, and kill what you can. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow. Tithe the rest to the Acolyte who commands you.<br/><br/>\nYou Acolytes, lead your Thrall in battle. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of the Thrall you lead. Then tithe the remainder to the Knight or Wizard who commands you. Thus you pay tribute.<br/><br/>\nYou Knights and Wizards, lead your followers in battle. Take enough devastation to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of your followers. Then take another portion, as much as you dare, and use it for your own purposes. But if it is too much, your peers will kill you and take it. Then tithe the remainder to the Ascendant you serve.<br/><br/>\nAn Ascendant will be those among the Hive who gather enough tribute to enter the netherworld. They will pay a tithe to those above them.<br/><br/>\nAnd thus the tribute will flow, up the chain, so that Savath&#251;n and Xivu Arath and myself will be fed by a great river of tribute, and we will use that excess to feed our gods, and to study the Deep. Thus all worms will be fed \u2014 as long as we continue our crusade.<br/><br/>\nThis is my law. I carve it thus, in ruin. Aiat.",

And he puts out his fist, full of black fire, and he swallows up the Emperor Raven with a wound.<br/><br/>\nAiat! Only Oryx knows this power, the power to take.<br/><br/>\nOn the seventh pace, the Perfect Raven comes out of Oryx\u2019s wound, and she spreads her wings across Taishibeth. Never again is a Taishibethi child born. She is perfect, she enacts the will of Oryx.<br/><br/>\nOn the eighth pace, the Tai say, listen, you are spoilers, you are sphincters and excreta, you rot, why do you kill? We made silver orbitals and golden star webs. We hatched eggs. We had a good thing. Our clothes were nice, our food was famous. With one of her feathers our Emperor could have tickled the gods.<br/><br/>\nOn the ninth pace, Oryx says, this is the only god, this ability to dictate what will and will not exist, this power to go on existing. This is your god. It is never ticklish.<br/><br/>\nOn the tenth pace the Taishibethi are extinct.<br/><br/>\nThen Oryx says, listen my siblings, do you know what we have done? We have conquered our way to the edge of the Deep. It whispers to me when I call on it, and it guides my flight. It says that we are at its threshold and that I should come inside.<br/><br/>\nI will go and speak to it.",

        "cardDescription": "Oryx, my King, my friend. Kick back. Relax. Shrug off that armor, set down that blade. Roll your burdened shoulders and let down your guard. This is a place of life, a place of peace.<br/><br/>\nOut in the world we ask a simple, true question. A question like, can I kill you, can I rip your world apart? Tell me the truth. For if I don\u2019t ask, someone will ask it of me.<br/><br/>\nAnd they call us evil. Evil! Evil means \u2018socially maladaptive.\u2019 We are adaptiveness itself.<br/><br/>\nAh, Oryx, how do we explain it to them? The world is not built on the laws they love. Not on friendship, but on mutual interest. Not on peace, but on victory by any means. The universe is run by extinction, by extermination, by gamma-ray bursts burning up a thousand garden worlds, by howling singularities eating up infant suns. And if life is to live, if anything is to survive through the end of all things, it will live not by the smile but by the sword, not in a soft place but in a hard hell, not in the rotting bog of artificial paradise but in the cold hard self-verifying truth of that one ultimate arbiter, the only judge, the power that is its own metric and its own source\u2014existence, at any cost. Strip away the lies and truces and delaying tactics they call \u2018civilization\u2019 and this is what remains, this beautiful shape.<br/><br/>\nThe fate of everything is made like this, in the collision, the test of one praxis against another. This is how the world changes: one way meets a second way, and they discharge their weapons, they exchange their words and markets, they contest and in doing so they petition each other for the right to go on being something, instead of nothing. This is the universe figuring out what it should be in the end.<br/><br/>\nAnd it is majestic. Majestic. It is the only thing that can be true in and of itself.<br/><br/>\nAnd it is what I am.",

In his fist he\u2019s got a black sun and he holds me by the throat and goes to tip the black sun inside me.<br/><br/>\nI can see my jaws in his goggles, three reflections of my jaws with so many teeth.<br/><br/>\nSo I start eating my dad. I bite huge pieces out of him and I claw him up.

This is our obligation as lords of the Hive, to make war upon each other, to eradicate weakness and make ourselves sharp.<br/><br/>\nOBLIGATIONS. Once, I permitted Oryx to kill me so that he could gain the sword logic and overcome Akka our God. This left me trapped deep in my throne. But Oryx my brother made war upon the Ecumene and in that war he described me, for I too am war. Thus I was resurrected.<br/><br/>\nRESURRECTION. Savath&#251;n and I conspired to strand Oryx on his expedition. But I secretly believe that I will be stronger with Oryx to war against. Thus I describe him.<br/><br/>\nA DESCRIPTION OF ORYX.<br/><br/>\nWhen Oryx looks upon you, you feel that you may vanish if he looks away.<br/><br/>\nThe crest of Oryx\u2019s skull is as long as an arm. In the course of its life, a thought moves from one end to the other. Upon his crest I have painted a line in my blood, so that he will remember me.<br/><br/>\nEach of Oryx\u2019s fangs has the precision of a finger and the acuity of an eye.<br/><br/>\nAlthough he was born at the bottom of the universe, and taught to burrow, Oryx has grown wings. The light of wildfire shines through them. Oryx teaches but he will not be taught.<br/><br/>\nOryx\u2019s body is corded with strength. His sinews and his muscles are as strong as his children, and his children are the strength of him.<br/><br/>\nOryx wears a raiment of worm silk, made from the caul of gods.<br/><br/>\nThe voice of Oryx may cause two different numbers to become equal.<br/><br/>\nOryx my Brother is the bravest thing I know. Upon Fundament he learned that we were the natural prey of the universe, the most frail and desperate of things. He thought about this carefully and he found a way to fix it. He made us strong. He will lead us into eternity.<br/><br/>\nOryx my Brother loves me and this love is war.",

Once I had made war on Savath&#251;n, and crippled her tribute so that she could never challenge me, and once I had tricked Xivu Arath, and poisoned her tribute so that she could never again try to take my tablets, and once I had arranged my own lineages so that I would be greatest among the Hive and secure on my throne \u2014 then I found a mother to make spawn.<br/><br/>\nOne of those spawn was you.<br/><br/>\nYour life will be a battle too. You will have to win your place at the High War. I will give you nothing... except this, your first sword, and this name I have prepared for you.<br/><br/>\nWe fight a war against false hope, Crota. We chase a god called the Traveler, a huckster god who baits young life into building houses for it. These houses are unsafe, for they cannot stand against my Hive. And these houses are a trap \u2014 for they lead young life away from the blade and the tooth, which are the tools of survival and the means of ascension.<br/><br/>\nOnly when the Traveler is extinguished will the universe be free to arrange itself, and assume, by ruthless contest, its final perfect shape, a shape which depends on nothing but itself.<br/><br/>\nThus I name you Crota, Eater of Hope.<br/><br/>\nThere is an oath upon me, Crota my son, an oath against the wretched Taox. This I do not give to you. It is for me, your father, to bear.<br/><br/>\nLet\u2019s go meet your aunts and uncles.",

Oversouls can be stored in a throne world as a mechanism of enhanced death resilience. As a side effect, new refinements to our Deathsong may be achieved, moving us closer to a generally effective paracausal death impulse.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx brandished his sword. \u201cSpeak the Royal Tongue, or I\u2019ll pin you up for Eir to eat.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIf we can separate our deaths from ourselves, and hide them, we will be hard to kill.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx went to his son, Crota. \u201cGo keep an eye on your sisters,\u201d he said. \u201c&#39;You can learn cunning from them.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut while Oryx traveled to observe the Deep destroy an ancient fortress world, Crota conspired with his sisters to learn their secrets. \u201cI too will experiment with a wound,\u201d he said. With his sword Crota cut open a new wound, into a new space. In here he thought he might obtain a secret power.<br/><br/>\nOut of this wound came machines called Vex.

        "cardDescription": "The Vex clattered around, constructing large problems. At first their constructions were deranged, because they didn\u2019t understand the sword logic, which defined all rules in Oryx\u2019s throne world. The geometry perplexed them.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ll cut them apart,\u201d Crota said. But just then, the Vex ritual-of-better-thoughts manifested a Mind called Quria, Blade Transform. Quria deduced the sword logic.<br/><br/>\nI have to kill everything, Quria resolved. Then I will be powerful.<br/><br/>\nCrota\u2019s gate began to emit warrior Vex, huge and brassy. He leapt forward to fight them, but they blinked away. After they fled from Crota, they killed two thousand of Oryx\u2019s Acolytes and ten thousand of his Thrall. Soon they had established themselves as powers in this world, by right of slaughter.<br/><br/>\n\u201cCome forth, sister wizards,\u201d called Ir Halak. \u201cWe need you.\u201d Ir An&#251;k pulled a sword star out of the sky. Together the wizards charged it with killing power and made an annihilator totem, which they used to smash the Vex.<br/><br/>\n\u201cClose the wound, brother Crota,\u201d An&#251;k ordered. \u201cWe will find a cunning way to destroy them, but only after they stop constructing problems on us.\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut Quria had instanced itself to the other side of the gate, and built a holdfast to keep the way open. Quria\u2019s objective was to exploit the paracausal physics of Oryx\u2019s throne to become divine. It organized a series of test invasions.<br/><br/>\nFor a hundred years of local time the siblings fought the Vex. When the Vex came into the sword world, they were inevitably annihilated, but when the Hive went into the Vex world, they lost too much of their power to win.<br/><br/>\n\u201cFather\u2019s going to eat our souls,\u201d Halak sighed.<br/><br/>\nQuria captured some worm larvae and began experimenting with them. Soon Quria, Blade Transform manifested religious tactics. By directing worship at the worms, Quria learned it could alter reality with mild ontopathogenic effects. Being an efficient machine, Quria manufactured a priesthood and ordered all its subminds to believe in worship. Then it set about abducting and killing dangerous organisms so it could bootstrap itself to Hive godhood. For some Vex reason, Quria never attempted to introduce worm larvae into its mind fluid.<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n was laughing, because she had tricked Crota into cutting that place.<br/><br/>\nThis drew the attention of the Worm our God. ORYX, called Eir. SET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER.",

        "cardDescription": "Oryx rushed home and read from the Tablets of Ruin. He put some of the Vex into wounds, to be taken by the power of the Deep. Thus he turned the Vex against each other. Quria manifested a range of tactics, but none of them were adaptive. Oryx crushed all the Vex in his throne.<br/><br/>\nOryx thought that he should study geometry, like the Vex. It was the map of perfect shapes. But first he had to punish imperfection.<br/><br/>\n\u201cMy son,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is your punishment. Come home glorious, or die forgotten!\u201d He picked up Crota by the legs and threw him into the Vex gate network.<br/><br/>\nCrota battled through history, becoming a legendary demon. In his early centuries he often spared a few victims to hear oaths and protests against his father. Later, he came to understand Oryx, and he made temples and monuments wherever he went.<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile, Oryx brooded on the Vex. \u201cI\u2019ve met a worthy rival,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to exist forever, just as I do. But I don\u2019t understand them.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAt this his worm began to chew on him, for he was bound to understand. <br/><br/>\nHe called Savath&#251;n to meet in the material world. She told him that the Vex worked tirelessly to understand everything, so that they could build a victory condition for every possible end state of the universe.<br/><br/>\n \u201cThen I must be a better king,\u201d Oryx said. \u201cIf they want to build an emperor for all outcomes, then I will be the king of only one. I will follow the Deep wherever it goes, and document its power. Let us create a catalog of the grave of worlds, which will be our map to victory.\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx knew that all life could be described as cellular automata, except for that life which understood the Deep or the Sky, and thus escaped causality.<br/><br/>\nOut of love for her brother, which was the same as the desire to kill him, Savath&#251;n leaked a secret to Xivu Arath \u2014 \u2018listen, Xivu, Oryx\u2019s throne world has been compromised. You can cut your way in from here.\u2019 Xivu Arath used this to plan an ambush.<br/><br/>\nBut Oryx was too canny. The Taken King said to his Court, the High War, \u201cMy throne world is vulnerable. I am going to move it.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u2018Where?\u2019 asked Kagoor, World-Render.<br/><br/>\n\u201cInto a mighty dreadnaught,\u201d said Oryx. \u201cI shall keep my glorious mind cosmos inside a titanic warship.\u201d",

It swelled up like a ghost star to smash the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible.

        "cardDescription": "By now, Quria knows it can\u2019t win.<br/><br/>\nThere\u2019s something pathological about the world inside Oryx\u2019s ship. It resists analysis with hot, dead spite. And Oryx himself, he\u2019s irreducible \u2014 he refuses to obey Quria\u2019s simulations, he crashes around sowing chaos, he grabs subminds and compromises them with some kind of ontological weapon. Paracausal systems. Very problematic.<br/><br/>\nQuria\u2019s trying the religious tactics it evolved in the Hive manifold. But even on those terms, Oryx is strong, so strong. Quria won\u2019t be able to protect its gates much longer.<br/><br/>\nThe closest Quria\u2019s got to a simulation of Oryx is a best-guess bootstrap. It\u2019s wrong \u2014 Quria\u2019s sure of that, it\u2019s Oryx minus the symbiote organism, minus the wings and morphs, minus the weapon, minus the power. No good for anything.<br/><br/>\nQuria manifests that simulation anyway. Just to see what happens.<br/><br/>\nThe Taken King marches on Quria\u2019s Hydra-hull, armed with blade and magic, cloaked in ancient cloth, and the universe wails in horror around him. Quria\u2019s physics models and toy worlds choke and crash.<br/><br/>\nQuria observes, alert and attentive, as a single quark splits on the tip of Oryx\u2019s sword.<br/><br/>\nFrom within the Hydra-hull, Quria\u2019s tiny not-Oryx speaks. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d it says. It\u2019s manifesting terror and awe.<br/><br/>\nOryx\u2019s eyes blaze with a curiosity that is entirely isomorphic with hate, with voracious hunger. \u201cAurash,\u201d he says, in his Hive language. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me as I was. You\u2019ve made a tiny Aurash. Ha!\u201d<br/><br/>\nQuria updates the simulation\u2019s name. Aurash is curious: \u201cYou\u2019re me? You\u2019re me as I become?\u201d<br/><br/>\nOryx kneels. His blade is on his left shoulder. Quria is firing every available weapon at him, but his wards don\u2019t break. He looks into Quria\u2019s sensors through the hammering fire and he says, \u201cChild, I have everything you wanted. I am immortal. I know the great secrets of the universe. I have scouted the edges of the Darkness and I have chased the lying god down galactic arms in a howling pack of moons. In my fist I carry the secret power that will rule eternity. In my worm I bear the tribute of my Court and of my children, the Hope-Eater, the Weaver, and the Unraveler; and with this tribute I smash my foes. I am Oryx, the Taken King. I am almighty.\u201d<br/><br/>\nQuria samples the Taox intelligence retrieved from the Ecumene gate. There are useful names. It feeds them to the simulation.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhat about your sisters?\u201d Aurash asks his future self. \u201cSathona? Xi Ro? Are they with you?\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Taken King\u2019s fangs glint. That sound might be a laugh, or a hiss.<br/><br/>\nQuria shuts down its weapons and puts all its spare resources into sending telemetry to the greater Vex. There will be points in space and time where this data is vital. There will be great projects undertaken in the study of this ontological power, this throne-space.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhere are my sisters?\u201d Aurash shouts. \u201cWhat have you done with my people? What have you done?\u201d<br/><br/>\nBut Oryx\u2019s fist is full of black fire, and the next thing Quria sees is a light like stars.",

Savath&#251;n\u2019s fleet has assembled here, in preparation for an assault on the Gift Mast. The Deep is headed that way, on the trail of its prey, and the Hive will be its vanguard.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Vex I captured. Quria, Blade Transform. It made an attempt to puncture my throne. I thought you might enjoy studying it.\u201d Oryx pauses, digesting \u2014 through the bond of lineage he can feel Crota killing, worlds and worlds away, and it tastes like sweet fat. \u201cQuria contains a Vex attempt to simulate me.

And yet being old doesn\u2019t feel like a scar, does it? It hasn\u2019t left me dull. I feel alive, alive with you, and every time I step back into this world from my throne I feel like I\u2019m two years old again, at the bottom of the universe, looking up.<br/><br/>\nBut he says, \u201cSister, it\u2019s us. We\u2019re the proof, we the Hive: if we last forever, we prove it, and if something more ruthless conquers us, then the proof is sealed.\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe looks back at him with eyes like hot needles. \u201cI like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s elegant.\u201d Although of course she has had this thought before.",

When the Traveler passed across Harmony, it lied to the orbits of ten worlds. Now they orbit the black hole. The Traveler lied to the accretion disc, so that it would give warm light to these worlds.<br/><br/>\nTHE GIFT MAST. When the Traveler left Harmony, it made a monument out of the black hole\u2019s polar jet. In the jet there is a hollow mast which sings in radiance. This is the Gift Mast and we will devour it, we will eat the Sky out of it, we will snap it like a bone.<br/><br/>\nTHE HARMONY STING. The Harmony have weaponized their dead star. They can stimulate the accretion disc to fire relativistic plasma jets. We will take the Sting. We will use it to burn their worlds. I will grant one temple of tribute to the first Ascendant to kill a world!<br/><br/>\nORYX. I will have the Gift Mast to feast on! I will have it first! I am Xivu Arath and all war is my temple. Beware the daughters of Oryx, for they make and unmake with ease.<br/><br/>\nSAVATH&#219;N. The Deceitful Sister will be distracted by arcana and the song of the black hole. Treat her broods with contempt.<br/><br/>\nTHE TRAVELER. We chase it and we will devour it. The Deep will rule the cosmos.<br/><br/>\nTHE DRAGONS. Our gods should be ours alone. Their smug freedom is an insult to me. I\u2019d shut them all in cells. Bring them to me!",

But the Harmony turn to dragon-wishes, and their wishful bishops wrestle Xivu in the ascendant plane.<br/><br/>\nXivu falls into deadlock.<br/><br/>\nNext arrives Savath&#251;n, flanked by her chorus and her celebrants. They trick their way onto Ana-Harmony in disguises, so that they might vivisect these dragons. The Worm our God laughs and laughs.<br/><br/>\nFor a hundred years Savath&#251;n keeps secret covens among the Harmony.<br/><br/>\nBut first of all was Oryx, whose brood grew in secret places in the rubble of the accretion disc. The First Navigator sends rocks and comets to crash into the Harmony worlds, so that the Harmony fleet will be disarrayed. He sends seeders to infiltrate the Harmony worlds with his broods.<br/><br/>\nHere at the center of the fifth book the Hive has grown so mighty that it has made the annihilation of all false life routine.<br/><br/>\nXivu Arath kills the wishful bishops, and Savath&#251;n achieves some secret purpose, and Oryx\u2019s Court tears down the Gift Mast. The Harmony people wail in terror, and they throw themselves into the silver lakes of Ana-Harmony to drown.<br/><br/>\n\u201cCome,\u201d sayeth Oryx, \u201ceat of the Gift Mast, for I am a generous god.

My daughters study the quiddity of death, my son practices the inhabitation of death, and my great work is, in ultima, to become synonymous with death, to die and in that dying live, so that if the universe comes to nothing then I will be a part of that nothing. Far better to have a savage universe with a happy end than a happy universe with no hope.<br/><br/>\nI have died many times but these deaths were only temporary.<br/><br/>\nIf my echoes are killed, and I am killed in the material world, then I will be driven back to my throne the Dreadnaught. If my Court and my throne can be beaten, if I am confronted in my throne, if I am defeated there, then I will die. My work will end.<br/><br/>\nThis is the pact to which I am bound, in particular by my study of the Tablets of Ruin, and by my use of the power of the Deep. When I call upon that power, I put myself up as the stakes in a wager, I gamble with my soul. For I am saying, listen, my gods, I am the mightiest thing there is, and I prove it thus.<br/><br/>\nLately I have realized how much I depend on Crota and my daughters, and even upon my court. If I lost them, my outlays would exceed my intakes, my tribute would not be enough to feed my worm. But this is proper \u2014 for if I lost them it would be because they were not mighty enough, and then I would be a bad father, a bad King. I must test them and fight with them, to keep them strong. This is my geas.<br/><br/>\nI will go on forever. I will understand everything. There is only one path and that is the path that you make. But you can make more than one path.<br/><br/>\nBreak your cell\u2019s bars. Make a new shape, make the shape from its path, find your cell\u2019s bars, break out of the bars, find a shape, make the shape from its path, eat the light, eat the path.<br/><br/>\nIf I fail, let me be wormfood.",

If Hive arcana is a metaphor, this is the meaning; if they make appeals, then this is the judge.<br/><br/>\nOryx wields this power. But Oryx did not make it. We face the same flower we met in the Black Garden.<br/><br/>\nThe process is simple: an aperture opens, like a jaw, and swallows a living thing. It passes into \u2014 another place. Later, it returns.<br/><br/>\nWhat returns is...<br/><br/>\nI try to use the word \u2018shadow\u2019 but Eris hisses at me. A shadow is a flat projection cast by a light and an object. Less real. Eris insists that these Taken are more real, somehow. She uses words like inhabited, exalted, rendered final...<br/><br/>\nIs this power blind? Just a natural energy Oryx discovered? I cannot believe it.<br/><br/>\nMy Hidden tell me that the Taken shine with seething, negative light. As if the universe is curling up around them. As if they radiate some pathology that decays into our world as nothingness...<br/><br/>\nThe Taken serve Oryx. But I think those jaws lead elsewhere.<br/><br/>\nI dream about what happens on the inside. I dream about what might happen. Are the victims devoured, and replaced by simulacra? Husked out and filled up? Is some mathematical operation conducted on them, translating them from one shape to another?<br/><br/>\nWhat would I see, if I leapt inside? What would happen to a Guardian? Is that how we end this \u2014 all of us leaping into the dark, to fill it up with light?<br/><br/>\nEris thinks there\u2019s a poetry to how the Taken change. She thinks we can chart the difference, and understand the will behind it.<br/><br/>\nI am afraid she may be right.",

Duty brought you here. Duty is all there was for you.<br/><br/>\nYour Emperor told you to get aboard the Dreadnaught at any cost. I will go with you, Tlu\u2019urn said, and you said no, no, this is my duty. I will fight with you, Mau\u2019ual said, and you said, turn back, I will do this alone.<br/><br/>\nYou loved them, so you left them, after you crashed your command into the target and you did your very damnedest. For the Emperor, for your duty, all against the howling horde. But it wasn\u2019t enough, was it? That code is not enough.<br/><br/>\nSometimes you have to go on alone.<br/><br/>\nThere is a knife for you. It is shaped like [loneliness]. Pick it up.<br/><br/>\nYou will not need these things any more: duty, camaraderie, pride. You will not need an Emperor or a Bond Brother or any other code. You will not need anything at all. You will be your own whole purpose, a beautiful final purpose, everlasting. Cut away these useless things.<br/><br/>\nTake the knife. Take it up and use it. Take your new shape.",

        "cardDescription": "RECORD 0-CHASM-0<br/><br/>\nMy love. I\u2019ve opened this log as an apology.<br/><br/>\nAs a scientist, I believe in record-keeping. I believe in protocols, peer review, and ethical conduct. I believe in the importance of disbelief \u2014 you know: let\u2019s run that one more time.<br/><br/>\nWhat I\u2019m doing here in Lhasa isn\u2019t science. It\u2019s unethical, secret, and shameful. And after what happened in Ishtar, dearest Chioma, I know you\u2019d be furious with me for getting involved. Forty years isn\u2019t far enough to forget a day like that.<br/><br/>\nBut I believe it\u2019s important. The least I can do is keep a few notes for you.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-01<br/><br/>\nTrial one. Subject one. <br/><br/>\nIt was an act of stupid loneliness. I used the device on myself because I...<br/><br/>\n[silence: 0:08]<br/><br/>\nI missed you. We hadn\u2019t been apart for more than a year since we met. I\u2019m not a very good wife, am I? You write me every week, even with all Hyperion\u2019s work and all Hyperion\u2019s distance keeping you from me. And I act like it\u2019s not enough. <br/><br/>\nWe built the device in mimicry of the Vex gateway systems from Ishtar. An observatory, yes, but I think of it as a mind-ship. Capable of displacing its payload across space and time.<br/><br/>\nThe lab is cold and isolated. We are quarantined from the world, physically and mentally. We can\u2019t send messages out. If we breach the Vex manifolds, even our words might transmit contagion. One night last month I missed you and so I \u2014<br/><br/>\nI thought that I could look inside the device, and find one of the other Chiomas. I thought I could call out to one of the forks we sent out there to explore.<br/><br/>\nI just wanted to send my love.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-02<br/><br/>\nZakharik Gilmanovich Bekhterev. May he rest in peace. When our probes continued to fail, when my report remained our only positive finding, he volunteered to use the device. One minute of subjective experience inside.<br/><br/>\nWe took precautions. They worked. Bekhterev\u2019s experience left no physical damage.<br/><br/>\nAfter we extracted him, he said that he felt determined. I asked him what he meant and he said that he meant it, he had been determined, he could feel all his choices set out before him like a railroad. Deviation was impossible.<br/><br/>\nHe died by suicide. I wonder if he was trying to make a point.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-03<br/><br/>\nWe\u2019ve decided not to abort. It\u2019s insane, isn\u2019t it? There are pressures on us I can\u2019t tell you about until I see you again.<br/><br/>\nThe purpose of the system is intelligence, you see. It\u2019s stenciled right on the hull: SxISR.  Special asset. We would very much like to make it work reliably. <br/><br/>\nOur supervisory warmind has devised a drug it says will protect and prepare us.<br/><br/>\nI am beginning to wonder if we were wrong about the merchant and the alchemist. Or if that explanation of time was incomplete.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-09<br/><br/>\nKind Lakpha. He meditated before he went in. Nothing but d&#233;j&#224; vu and three seconds of screams. The screaming passed and he remembers nothing. The d&#233;j&#224; vu hasn\u2019t. He says it\u2019s getting better \u2014 he feels that we\u2019ve had this conversation only ten times before, not a thousand. <br/><br/>\nI\u2019ve suggested that we attempt mind forking. We need more sane people to work with. Please forgive me, my love.<br/><br/>\nWe are all growing superstitious. The behavior of the device is inconsistent. Impossible to replicate. We turn to ritual behavior to appease it.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-31<br/><br/>\nRajesh. When he reached a displacement of eight he told us he was dead. I believed him. He was dead. He spoke to us. It was true. Whatever he saw, it was his own future.<br/><br/>\nHe\u2019s fine, afterwards. When I look into his eyes I wonder what came back wearing his skin. But that thought is unscientific.<br/><br/>\nWe speak of nothing but the device. We talk about it like a demigod. When I get out of here I know the whole world will look like a fraying veil.<br/><br/>\nI think it\u2019s clear that part of the problem is substrate. We need more than flesh and drug to survive this.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-52<br/><br/>\nI heard you, my love. I was at six, oscillating on the event axis, coordinated with a known manifold. I heard you. You were talking to me \u2014 not me, but another me, another Maya Sundaresh.<br/><br/>\nYou said, my love, so many strange things have happened, and it\u2019s been so long. We\u2019ve come so far. Do you ever want to go home?<br/><br/>\nAnd I said, not me but the other me, I said, my love, I am always home.<br/><br/>\nI\u2019m resigning, my love. I\u2019m done with this work and I\u2019m done with being apart from you. I\u2019ll see you again soon. I can\u2019t take this journal out with me, so I\u2019ve left it for the others, and asked them to continue the log.<br/><br/>\nMaybe it\u2019ll become a tradition. The gospel of our little cult.",

        "cardDescription": "General Chen Lanshu is flying her glider.<br/><br/>\nShe carves around the huge bulb nose of a colony ship, one of the Cosmodrome\u2019s towering children.  Her eyes see temperature: she surfs the winter air rolling down off the cryo-chilled fuel tank.  Turbulence rattles her bones.<br/><br/>\n\u201cGeneral,\u201d Malahayati sends. \u201cYou\u2019re making Rasputin nervous.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAm I?\u201d Lanshu banks, grinning, spiraling around the fuel tank.  The machine hates risk.  Risk to the General, sure, but also risk to Rasputin\u2019s ships.  \u201cIs that the word he used, exactly?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe can be very charming,\u201d the submind assures her.  Malahayati works with Chen Lanshu, and she is certainly charming, but this is Rasputin\u2019s territory, Rasputin the tacit king, the brooding wary first-among-equals.<br/><br/>\nYesterday Lanshu spoke to a colony ship AI and it called Rasputin \u2018the Tyrant.\u2019  Not without affection.  And certainly not without respect.<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe can charm me in person,\u201d Lanshu suggests.<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe\u2019s very private, lately.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThen he can sulk.\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe spreads her arms and legs and climbs a thermal, whirling up, arrowing off the top and out away from the colony ships towards the defensive wall.  Her glider\u2019s a second skin, whipcrack-taut paramuscle, like a flying fox.<br/><br/>\nThe Cosmodrome races past beneath her.  She waggles her wings at a cloud of passing sensor mites: a saucy hello.  Two of the security division\u2019s MBTs drill in the mothyards.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you came,\u201d Malahayati says.  She\u2019s probably lying. Malahayati understands Lanshu very, very well.  \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you masked yourself yesterday, during the launch.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe launch.  SABER GREEN.  Rasputin quietly moving another doomsday weapon into Earth orbit.  And all the other launches, too, not just weapons but people, the colonization schedule pushed up... as if the need to disperse is now imperative.<br/><br/>\nGeneral Chen Lanshu banks out across the Wall.  Look at all that beauty!  Look at the highway rolling off across green hills and grey mountains.  Imagine, now, imagine if she just landed and started walking, out away from everything, into the wilderness...<br/><br/>\n\u201cImagine something going wrong,\u201d she says.  \u201cImagine this road choked with corpses. Imagine the security team gunning down refugees as they try to force their way onto the ships. Imagine cars from here to the horizon\u2014 \u201d those stupid old-fashioned cars everyone still owns, because the strange uneven advancement of this post-Traveler world leaves some things unchanged.<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou expect violence?\u201d Malahayati says, in that conciliatory, careful way of hers, her way of managing meat people.  \u201cSomething beyond our capability to preempt or contain?\u201d<br/><br/>\nExpect? As a military professional? No, no. But\u2014<br/><br/>\nOnce, when she was younger, sixty or seventy, Chen Lanshu pulled rank to get a look at the Never-Be installation in Taipei.  She watched the images in the fresco and she felt... this foreboding, this enormous weight, a dread that refused to attach itself to any specific threat.  And she felt it again, last year, when she was briefed on the project in Lhasa, the vision machine...<br/><br/>\nShe shivers.  Her wings shudder and tremble in the airstream.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what we do, Mala?\u201d she says. \u201cWhy we still have soldiers? Why we made you? Expectation.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Traveler came out of nowhere.  Entirely unanticipated.<br/><br/>\nImagine if it hadn\u2019t been friendly.  Imagine that.<br/><br/>\nRasputin surely has.",

I could feel His presence and if I still had a Ghost I am sure it would have screamed.<br/><br/>\nI, too, am detached from my source.

She defined for me the quiddity of death, and she sang the song of that fearful autonomy. Revelation, my friends, it does go down hard. The definition killed me. The killing redefined me.<br/><br/>\nThis is the shape and the point of the tooth: nothing has ever lived that will not die.<br/><br/>\nNow I fly between green-black suns in the labyrinth beyond Crota\u2019s god-star. This is the Overworld, the Sea of Screams, where the throne-universes of the great Hive fester in eternal majesty. I move among them. I map the shapes and connections of this world.<br/><br/>\nI want to appear in the Tower and taunt them, lo, lo, I never sleep, I dance in light and shadow, I never sleep, I will never die. I will never die. I want to ask them: if you followed your laws here, to this trembling fearful place, of what use were those laws?<br/><br/>\nBut I have work to do. I shout into deep places. Osiris! I call. Osiris, Osiris! Can you hear me?<br/><br/>\nSometimes I think he answers. Sometimes I wonder what became of Eris. She was very tenacious.<br/><br/>\nFor the first time I am lonely.",

With Father, every question was vast, particularly those that looked simple.  And simple questions deserved as much insight and wisdom as could be brought to bear.<br/><br/>\nWith that in mind, I said nothing.<br/><br/>\nWhy would my father hate maps?<br/><br/>\nOne of his collaborators came into the office.  Father didn\u2019t have employees.  Or assistants.  And for that matter, he didn\u2019t have heroes either.  Every person, living or lost, was a collaborator, and that included his children.<br/><br/>\n\u201cClovis,\u201d said the visitor.<br/><br/>\nFather heard the woman, but he was watching me.<br/><br/>\nThe woman was pretty, and I was sixteen.  So I looked at her, smiling enough for both of us.  And she threw an appreciative wink my way as she described test results from the last five billion runs of our AI Initiative.<br/><br/>\nOut on the Martian desert, my father and picked collaborators were building housing too cold for this universe and too swift to be real.<br/><br/>\nAnd I was a sixteen year-old boy smiling at a pretty woman.<br/><br/>\nMy father thanked her for the update, and she left.<br/><br/>\nJust as I feared, he never looked away from me.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you hate maps,\u201d I admitted.<br/><br/>\nWith Father, ignorance was never the worst crime.  What was awful was pretending to have insight and wisdom where neither existed.<br/><br/>\n\u201cMaps end,\u201d he said.<br/><br/>\nI nodded, just a little.<br/><br/>\n\u201cMaps insist on having borders and edges or the table falls away.  Which isn\u2019t the way the universe works.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, no,\u201d I agreed.<br/><br/>\nThen he asked me, \u201cSo how does the universe work?\u201d<br/><br/>\nI pretended to take my time, considering various smart answers.  But I ended up using my first impulse.<br/><br/>\n\u201cEffortlessly,\u201d I said.<br/><br/>\nHe laughed.  Which wasn\u2019t uncommon for my father, but it was heartening to hear just then.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhat else can you tell me?\u201d he asked.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe universe is infinite and probably in multiple ways,\u201d I said.  Then I listed a few examples:  The census of stars, the Many-Worlds principle in quantum mechanics, and the endless measure of tiny realms hiding inside every grain of Martian sand.<br/><br/>\nFather nodded.<br/><br/>\nThe smile died.<br/><br/>\nThen he said something ominous.  Although I didn\u2019t appreciate it at the time.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe universe is someone\u2019s map,\u201d he said.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIs it?\u201d I muttered.<br/><br/>\n\u201cYes, oh yes.  And what we\u2019re doing here... we\u2019re reaching beyond the boundaries, out into the unknown.  And we pull back new colors to put on this map that can never, ever let itself be finished.\u201d<br/><br/>\nI nodded, smiling like the good son.<br/><br/>\nBut I was sixteen, and my thoughts were mostly about the pretty woman who had winked at me.",

As the Silver was cryptographically unique, she was stunned to meet an Awoken Warlock named Fenchurch who possessed around his neck a Silver coin of his own, signed with the exact same key as Tess&#39;s.  Like all Guardians, Fenchurch has no memories before the first time his Ghost resurrected him. But their Silver coins&#39; shared origin leads Tess and Fenchurch to suspect that they are related.<br/><br/>\nFenchurch instantly took to thinking of Tess as a long-lost niece, even assuming her surname, Everis.  Tess loves the Silver that her new partnership with Fenchurch brings\u2014 but, though she&#39;d never admit it, she secretly values her newfound family even more.",

A single long rib cage, the size of an aircraft fuselage.<br/><br/>\nThe living creatures themselves, we found a hundred meters down.  They might have been worms, if worms had scales and teeth and moved more quickly than a man could run.<br/><br/>\nJun died first.  And then Luli.  Bad deaths.  Deaths not worth thinking about, and so I don\u2019t, as I wander these tunnels, lost, waiting to run out of oxygen.<br/><br/>\nWill it hurt, I wonder?  That final sleep, when it comes.  The sleep that isn\u2019t sleep.<br/><br/>\nBut then everything on the Moon is named for what it\u2019s not.  Have you noticed? <i>The Sea of Serenity.</i><i>Ocean of Storms.</i><i>The Sea of Rains.</i>  It\u2019s only fitting.<br/><br/>\nIn the tunnels though, we found things that were exactly what they were, and so now I name them thus.  Mark them well, if this recording is found.<br/><br/><i>The Circle of Bones.</i><i>The Chamber of Night.</i><br/><br/>\nOne does not walk amid those dark tunnels and not lose something.  They say that to look out upon the ocean is to feel small.  But to walk in these caverns is to feel your grasp on reality slipping.<br/><br/>\nThere is no returning to what you were before: a believer of science, and the fundamental rationality of the universe.  Not after seeing those worms.<br/><br/>\nBut here now, at the bottom I have found the other side of the nightmare.  Like waking from a dream only to realize you were still asleep.  Perhaps my oxygen is getting low.  Yes, I can see it is.  Hypoxia already setting in.  The thing before me is like myself\u2014partly alive, and partly not.  An ossified afterbirth.  A pulsating tumor.<br/><br/>\nIt lays in a crater of its own making.  Dark and jagged.  So here I\u2019ll sit, and lay me down.  I see a doorway, and within, the death-white egg cases of nightmares yet to come.<br/><br/>\nAnd glad I am to miss it.",

His person clad in ornate, golden-etched plating, trophies upon his shoulders.<br/><br/>\nThis was before the City was The City.<br/><br/>\nThis is before the walls. Still in the shadow of the fragile giant above, but before.<br/><br/>\nSalvation seekers came \u2014 survivors; weary remnants of a people on the brink.<br/><br/>\nThese were the days before reason took hold. Before study was merged with belief.<br/><br/>\nThe giant was looked to as one would a God.  Maybe it still is.<br/><br/>\nFactions grew from the huddled masses. Like minds coming together to provide support, comfort. Over time these loyalties demanded loyalty. Differences that used to inform \u2014 viewpoints that when joined granted a larger understanding of the whole \u2014 became points of conflict. The sanctuary became divided. The shadow of Light grew darker. This, humanity\u2019s last oasis, slowly fading to a mirage.<br/><br/>\nGreat, powerful men and women, The Risen, stood at the Factions\u2019 sides. Protection. Enforcers. Misused possibility.<br/><br/>\nMisery crept into this false paradise. Yet hope lingered.<br/><br/>\nSeeing the cracks in this society born beneath the giant\u2019s fractured shell, some among The Risen challenged the dissolution of all that could be. They would no longer serve as instruments of oppression. They would be more.<br/><br/>\nThus began an unnecessary war made necessary by greed, ambition... fear. And, in the chaos of this struggle, came the scavengers \u2014 aliens with appetites. A common enemy.<br/><br/>\nIn the end, the scavengers were repelled and the Factions fell, their grip broken, though their beliefs remained. This was the earliest days of the Guardians, when might found purpose. Prosperity was in reach.<br/><br/>\nRezyl had been a champion of these wars. A leader. Against the alien pirates he had been more. If the giant wasn\u2019t a God, then maybe Rezyl was.<br/><br/>\nAs the first walls formed \u2014 built of hard work and sacrifice \u2014 Rezyl and the Guardians stood against the alien plunderers time and again. More survivors arrived. More warriors.<br/><br/>\nThe Guardian ranks swelled.<br/><br/>\nThe City grew.<br/><br/>\nHope blossomed. To Rezyl it was a currency. Hope bought tomorrow. Tomorrow bought the effort needed to survive today.<br/><br/>\nYet Rezyl grew weary. Stories haunted his nights. Old stories. Those no longer told. Those locked behind tight lips for fear of what they may invoke. Whenever the sun dropped below the horizon and the moon rose high, Rezyl\u2019s thoughts wandered. How safe was safe? How long could they fight with the Darkness still writhing?<br/><br/>\nSo, every day Rezyl would fight and build and protect. And every day a city grew beneath the giant. And every night he would think about all that was never said and stare intently at the moon above.",

While both served the Light, in all other ways they were rivals. One spent his days searching forgotten places for lost treasures. The other sought ever-greater challenges in a ceaseless quest for glory.<br/><br/>\n\u201cOne day, both Guardians detected a strange signal coming from a buried city on Mars. The Warlock, hoping to find forgotten caches, vowed to keep his secret until he alone had a chance to explore the site. The Hunter, seeing a chance to earn the renown she craved, also told no one.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThus both Guardians walked into peril alone and unprepared.<br/><br/>\nIt was not long before their paths crossed. The Warlock mocked his rival\u2019s pride. The Hunter ridiculed her rival as a dirt-grubber. In their anger, they turned on one another ...and never saw danger approach.<br/><br/>\nThe Sand Eaters came in force. The Centurions jumped into range before the Guardians could react. The steps of the Colossus shook the ground. The Phalanx\u2019s shields created a wall that no weapon could penetrate, and the Legionaries moved in for the kill.<br/><br/>\nFaced with certain destruction, the Guardians did the only thing they could. They fought. Back to back, they battled the Cabal for a day and a night. Black oil soaked into the sands until the ground was slick with death. The shields and armor of the dead littered the battlefield, but still the Cabal came.<br/><br/>\nThe Guardians died, revived, and died again. Still they fought, protecting one another. With his last bit of strength, the Warlock used the Void to destroy their enemies. With her last bullet, the Hunter saved her friend from the Colossus.<br/><br/>\nAt last, the battlefield fell silent. Only the Guardians stood. Abandoning their quests, they returned to the City to warn the Vanguard of the threat rising on Mars.<br/><br/>\nFrom that day to this, the pair have been the closest of companions. In their journeys together, they have found both riches and renown. But these things mean nothing unless they are shared.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWait, I thought I\u2019d heard this story before, but it was about two Guardians and the Hive?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t. It was about the Vault of Glass.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhoever said there was only one story?\u201d",

Beneath it the Vandal\u2019s neck gave; a hiss of ether burst free before dissipating.<br/><br/>\nRezyl turned. Three Dregs charged. Their Captain raised his shock blade high, unleashing a battle cry to fuel their courage.<br/><br/>\nFocused fire spit from the muzzle of Rezyl\u2019s full-auto. The Dregs fell.<br/><br/>\nTo the Captain, Rezyl was a trophy that would buy unmatched respect among his Devil brothers.<br/><br/>\nTo Rezyl, the Captain was already an afterthought. As ether leaked from the pirate\u2019s broken body with each blow of Rezyl\u2019s heavy fists, Rezyl\u2019s attention had shifted to the unknown, but inevitable, battles to follow.<br/><br/>\nThis was the state of things; conflict as common as breath.<br/><br/>\n&#8212; The Tescan Valley Encounter &#8212;<br/><br/>\nA Ketch with unfamiliar markings hung low between two peaks. A rare sight. Fallen flagships weren\u2019t known to linger so close to the surface, preferring constant motion, like sharks on the hunt.<br/><br/>\nSkiffs circled below the Ketch as their crews prepared to plunder any treasures the facility held.<br/><br/>\nRezyl leveled his rocket launcher. A digital ping signaled a lock, and a trail of smoke shot toward the lead Skiff.<br/><br/>\nTwo more rockets followed in rapid succession.<br/><br/>\nThe lead Skiff took two hits, lurched and retreated back toward the Ketch above.<br/><br/>\nThe third rocket caught a trailing Skiff as the craft turned to engage its attackers.<br/><br/>\nRezyl looked back. \u201cGo.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take a Ketch alone,\u201d Hassa laughed.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe ship isn\u2019t my target,\u201d Rezyl had a plan. Hassa hated Rezyl\u2019s plans with equal parts envy and concern.<br/><br/>\n\u201cLead the Skiffs away,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet\u2014 \u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cCan\u2019t meet if you\u2019re dead,\u201d Tover shot back.<br/><br/>\nRezyl smiled beneath his helm, \u201cGo.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHassa and Tover throttled their Sparrows and disappeared into the heavy woods. Rezyl watched from cover as the Skiffs gave chase.<br/><br/>\nThe Fallen below had taken defensive positions. The rocket attack caught them off guard but they were ready now, and there were more of them than he had time to count.<br/><br/>\nRezyl raced down the slope, weaving between the thick growth of brush and pine, on a direct path for the Fallen clustered at the mountain\u2019s base, his Ghost at his side.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI need you to hang back.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cUhhh...\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cTrust me.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAlways have.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHow quick can you light my spark?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou expect to die? Can\u2019t say that\u2019s the best\u2014 \u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHow quick?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cQuick.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBe ready.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cFor?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost slowed as the Guardian hit the valley floor. <br/><br/>\nThe Fallen opened fire.<br/><br/>\nRezyl leapt from his Sparrow as it transmatted away, his rifle spraying lead at the entrenched pirates.<br/><br/>\nThe Fallen\u2019s Arc bolts peppered Rezyl. Eager Dregs rushed and were met with death as Rezyl marched forward.<br/><br/>\nA massive blast cratered the ground a few feet from the Titan. The Ketch had turned its guns on Rezyl.<br/><br/>\nAnother blast impacted to Rezyl\u2019s left and he stumbled. A third exploded directly in his path...<br/><br/>\n...and Rezyl fell.<br/><br/>\nFrom the treeline, his Ghost watched as the Fallen celebrated and a Skiff drifted down from the Ketch above.<br/><br/>\nThe circle around Rezyl\u2019s body parted and the imposing figure of their Kell stepped forward to admire his prize.<br/><br/>\nThe chittering excitement quieted to a steady drone as the Kell lifted Rezyl\u2019s limp body by the neck.<br/><br/>\nA chorus rose among the crew, growing louder as the Kell hefted Rezyl over his head for all to see.<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost darted low through the crowd. He didn\u2019t like Rezyl\u2019s plan, but now he understood it.<br/><br/>\nDistracted by their Kell\u2019s triumph, the Ghost\u2019s presence went unnoticed until a beam of light swept over Rezyl\u2019s body.<br/><br/>\nThe mood shifted instantly, cheers turning to ravenous shouts.<br/><br/>\nThe Kell\u2019s gaze fell to the Ghost as the beam faded.<br/><br/>\nThe circle began to collapse \u2014 the Fallen set to pounce.<br/><br/>\nAs the Kell moved to toss Rezyl aside, cold steel met the underside of the alien marauder\u2019s jaw, followed by a red flash as Rezyl pulled his cannon\u2019s trigger.<br/><br/>\nEther spewed in an angry geyser and the Kell\u2019s grip loosened. Rezyl hit the ground and unloaded five more rounds into the Fallen leader\u2019s torso. The monster dropped.<br/><br/>\nFrenzied, the Kell\u2019s crew closed in like a flood.<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost lifted above the fray, frantic, \u201cNow! Now! Now!\u201d<br/><br/>\nIn one motion, Rezyl rose from a crouch, his fists clenched and raised high as a storm of Arc Light built within him, his full might raining down on the Kell\u2019s chest. The shockwave of Rezyl\u2019s attack hit like a meteor, shattering <br/>\nthe Kell\u2019s body and any Fallen within the Havoc storm\u2019s radius.<br/><br/>\nThe remaining Fallen staggered, knocked back and dazed.<br/><br/>\nRezyl triggered his Sparrow.<br/><br/>\nHis Ghost flew to his side, \u201cWe leaving?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBefore that Ketch opens up on us.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl punched the throttle as the Fallen crew opened fire.<br/><br/>\n\u201cLet\u2019s never do that again,\u201d his Ghost pleaded.<br/><br/>\nRezyl didn\u2019t have to reply. If war was a constant, \u201cnever\u201d was just an illusion. <br/><br/>\n&#8212; In Defense of North Channel &#8212;<br/><br/>\nWinds from the south caught the smoke and began to clear the thick air.<br/><br/>\nSlowly, the citizens of the small, snow-covered settlement came out from their hiding places.<br/><br/>\nRezyl surveyed their faces \u2014 each weary, but flecked with hope. <br/><br/>\nLiving in the wilds was all they had known. Surviving. Fighting. Hiding. These people had heard stories of a safer place, but tales of a better life were so rarely true.<br/><br/>\nRezyl and his companions had been tracking these Fallen for weeks. Had they caught them sooner this town would have been spared. That any survivors climbed from the rubble to see another day marked this as a victory, but Rezyl <br/>\nwas growing tired of small wins, however meaningful.<br/><br/>\nThat evening, Rezyl and the others led a gathering of survivors on the long journey to the growing city beneath the Traveler. Some settlers remained behind, choosing to stake their claim in the untamed wilds.<br/><br/>\nRezyl admired their resolve, but never looked back. He knew whatever death these brave pioneers avoided that day would come to them... someday... in one form or another.",

It\u2019s been challenging. Without the influence of Shuro Chi, their natural mistrust of the Reef\u2019s new leadership has led to personality clashes. The Techeuns were very used to their relationship with the Throne. While the Queen&#39;s Wrath is trying to monitor hotspot issues, she is being met with challenges at every turn.<br/><br/><i>(For reference, please see reports 13455.45, 13455.58, and 13455.98: Post Taken War Reef politics, Tech Witch Conversations and Petra, and Assassination Attempts, Petra)</i><br/><br/>\nAfter some initial trials with Prison specimens, we can report the program is now ready for full-scale production. Please see Reports 13458.66 and .55 for video feeds and notations on the initial trials. Reports .80 through .86 cover the trials involving the Techeuns. The power they wield in the transferal process ensures a 100% success rate, and we are now confident only one Techeun will need to be present for the transfer.<br/><br/>\nBelow find remaining pertinent notations. We have received approval from the Queen\u2019s Wrath to move forward, and thus future reports will detail production output and any changes to the process.<br/><br/>\n -  Transferred Taken power has a throughput rate of <b><i>[redacted]</i></b> which is obviously lower than we want. Transfer still results in incredibly potent arms and armor, so for the moment this \u2018noise\u2019 is acceptable. Future improvements to the process will attempt to up the throughput rate.<br/>\n -  Supply was initially raised as concern during trials, but whatever measures House Judgment has put into place to stock the Prison also assures numerous sources of Taken power. Coordination between House Judgment and production is an ongoing task.<br/>\n -  The Queen\u2019s Wrath has already stated she will handle the diplomatic side of this discussion. Legwork during initial trials raised the possibility the Vanguard would have concerns about the moral aspect of this technology, but the Wrath has stated it will not be an issue.<br/>\n -  High frequency sound baffling for production facilities is still being installed. Taken screams can shatter plastics and burst blood vessels if not baffled, and at full-scale production that kind of auditory byproduct will be a constant.",

A lot more of us are starting to find our Guardians latel\u2014 what&#39;s that?&quot;<br/><br/>\nCassiopeia resolved to run a full-range self-diagnostic before the next grid. Two Ghosts within twenty meters and she didn&#39;t sense either one? Something was off.<br/><br/>\nThe new arrival chirped and spoke up. &quot;Hello, you two! I&#39;m glad ~identify(OBSIDIAN)~ to see a friendly face! I haven&#39;t been myself lately.&quot;<br/><br/>\nObsidian looked at Cassiopeia. He read as nervous. She probably did, too.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I was beneath the Blind Watch for a while. A long ~SIVA.MEM.GH404~ while. It was fun! There were puzzles. No one was alive down there, though.&quot;<br/><br/>\nCassiopeia&#39;s scan of the new Ghost returned nothing amiss. &quot;Are you okay, friend?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m great! Something got in me but the Light ~if (LIGHT) then WARNING~ burned it away. It&#39;s gone forever, now! ~consume: FAILURE replicate:FAILURE enhance:FAILURE~&quot;<br/><br/>\nThere was silence for a full three seconds. Then Obsidian spoke up, his words coming quickly.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Well, great to see you again, Cassiopeia! Good luck!&quot; He zipped away.<br/><br/>\nCassiopeia watched him disappear into the horizon. &quot;TWO self-diagnostics,&quot; she muttered.",

The sound, thick and pained, echoed across the narrow valley then fell silent.<br/><br/>\nAfter a beat that felt like eternity, the figure backed away into the dark.<br/><br/>\nThe doors remained wide \u2013 an invitation or a dare, Rezyl did not know. Nor did he care.<br/><br/>\nThe mighty Titan took steps forward.<br/><br/>\n\u201cUhhhh... I\u2019m not sure this is a good idea,\u201d his Ghost\u2019s concern was impossible to mistake.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNot sure that matters.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come. We\u2019ve seen. Maybe the best course here is to warn others. Gather an army.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying... It\u2019s possible you can\u2019t handle whatever it is we\u2019ve upset here.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019ve woken nightmares.\u201d Rezyl\u2019s attention was singular; focused intently on the dark beyond the threshold.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe Hive were supposed to be gone.\u201d The Ghost mulled the full consequence of this mistaken belief. \u201cThey\u2019ve been silent for\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThey\u2019re not silent anymore.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat scream? These doors? They\u2019re best left alone.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl continued forward. Toward the dark. Toward the unknown.<br/><br/>\n\u201cStay here.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cGet distance. We don\u2019t know what this is... what\u2019s coming. Can\u2019t risk you too close to an unknown.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAnd if you fall where I can\u2019t find you?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIf I fall... If I don\u2019t return. Run. Tell the others. Warn them all... There are worse things than pirates.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRezyl steadied his rifle and stepped into the dark, as his Ghost lingered.<br/><br/>\n&#8212;-<br/><br/>\nHours passed. More? Time was lost in this place, and with it any remembrance of hope... of promise... of purpose in the longing for a brighter tomorrow. <br/><br/>\nDown amongst the shadows there were no tomorrows.<br/><br/>\nDown in the abyss there was no hope.<br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s footfalls echoed; lonely, measured steps with no guarantee of purchase. At any moment the world could fall away and he would be lost \u2013 the forgotten hero who foolishly sought nightmares.<br/><br/>\nThen, a presence. Sweeping and dream-like.<br/><br/>\nRezyl leveled his rifle.<br/><br/>\nHe could sense the witch, but found it impossible to track her in the dark.<br/><br/>\nRezyl opened fire. Short, focused bursts to light the ebony corridor.<br/><br/>\nThe demon witch circled just beyond the reach of each burst\u2019s glow.<br/><br/>\nRezyl kept firing, using the short flickers of light to gain bearing. <br/><br/>\nThe witch laughed and a thick black cloud engulfed Rezyl. <br/><br/>\nThe Titan kept firing but his movements were restricted. The cloud confined him, caged him.<br/><br/>\nHe could hear her moving just beyond his sight as her laughter rose in pitch, cutting into Rezyl\u2019s mind and soul like a tempered blade.<br/><br/>\nRezyl flinched as the wicked woman began to speak in a tongue that resembled torture more than language.<br/><br/>\nThe pain was searing, complete.<br/><br/>\nThe demon approached the writhing hero.<br/><br/>\nAs she spoke her violent words began to take shape, morphing from syllables of death to a known offering of haunted human languages.<br/><br/>\nThe demon woman leaned in close... and whispered, intimately. <br/><br/>\nRezyl\u2019s ears bled as she spoke.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I am the end of &#39;morrows. Xyor, the Blessed. Xyor, the Betrothed. I am of the coming storm. These are not my words, but prophesy. Your Light will one day shatter and die. For now it simply offends... And you, dear, sweet, fragile thing, shall be made to suffer for your transgressions upon this holy ground.&quot;<br/><br/>\nAs the witch fell silent, her hateful voice was replaced by a growing chorus of hungry, manic chittering and the rising thunder of an approaching flood.<br/><br/>\nRezyl had come looking for the terrors that hide just beyond the light.<br/><br/>\nHe found them.<br/><br/>\nOr, maybe...<br/><br/>\n...they found him.",

        "cardDescription": "<i>He always survives.</i><br/><br/>\nHelmet in one hand and torch in the other, Saladin Forge marches through the snow. He can sense the wolves emerge around him; only three of them come into view, but this group has followed him on his patrols since the Devils raided the Plaguelands. He has given up dissuading them. They\u2019re defending their territory, and Saladin can relate to that. But they will not last long.<br/><br/>\nNothing does. Not the Golden Age. Not the colony ships. Not the impenetrable walls of the Cosmodrome.<br/><br/>\nNot the Iron Lords.<br/><br/>\nHe discards his torch, and glances up to see a familiar glow reaching out from the dark. He smirks. A horde of Devil Splicers returns his stare from the wreckage of the wall ahead.<br/><br/>\nThe Splicers are doomed. Just as the Iron Lords were, when he and his allies opened that vault. As Fallen continue to pour through the gap in the wall, they remind him of his friends in their final moment: a crimson pulse beats in place of their hearts. <i>SIVA.</i><br/><br/>\nHe puts his helmet on as an Iron battle axe forms in his hand, the air around him bursting into flame. The first wave of dregs approaches. Saladin breaks into a charge, swinging the axe to bear as he smashes into a storm of steel and weapons fire.<br/><br/>\nAs his axe bites, again and again, Skorri\u2019s Iron Song haunts him. He calls upon Radegast\u2019s strength. Perun\u2019s sense of purpose. Timur\u2019s questions. Felwinter\u2019s cynicism. Silimar\u2019s persistence. Gheleon\u2019s reasoning. <br/><br/>\nJolder\u2019s smile. <br/><br/>\nHe pounds the last Splicer priest like a burning hammer, blasting a crater into the snow and gravel. Frozen dirt rains down on the spent shells and the mounds of Splicer corpses that surround him. The Warlocks of the City have described meditation to him. He imagines it feels like this.<br/><br/><i>He always survives. When nothing else does.</i><br/><br/>\n\u201cLord Saladin? What\u2019s your status?\u201d calls Shiro-4 through his audio feed.<br/><br/>\n\u201cJust\u2014 Taking a walk,\u201d he says, staring at the fifteen-foot divide he broke in the earth. He had to meet SIVA again. One last time.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ve analyzed the Clovis Bray data.\u201d<br/><br/><i>Timur always said that Clovis Bray was the key. </i><br/><br/>\n\u201cCan you break the Splicers\u2019 hold over SIVA?\u201d<br/><br/><i>How different would things be, had Saladin listened?</i><br/><br/>\n\u201cTheoretically. Temporarily.\u201d<br/><br/><i>Would his friends still live? Would he?</i><br/><br/>\n\u201cIt might be enough. Perhaps our Guardian has turned the tide. I\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe sees the wolves have formed up around him. Eight of them.<br/><br/><i>He always survives.</i>",

The ether power emanations that once glowed strong and pure were obviously corrupted.<br/><br/>\nGuardians had slain this god. And now it was reborn, through SIVA.<br/><br/>\nVariks of House Judgment sneered at the abomination. \u201cGolden Age project, yes?\u201d he clicked, turning to the Crow. His field agent was a young Awoken woman. \u201cTechnology of old Earth. Learned from the Great Machine.\u201d<br/><br/>\nThe Eliksni burbled to himself in mocking laughter and gestured with his lower hands. \u201cYou do us proud. Go. Speak with other Crows, learn more about these... Devil Splicers.\u201d She nodded, a small smile on her face, and left the chamber.<br/><br/>\nVariks allowed himself a moment of silent contemplation, looking at the now-closed door to the information suite. As always, it was lit only by the light of the dozen or so monitors in the room. <br/><br/>\nThe Fallen interlocked his upper hands. He bowed his head as he allowed himself to really feel the impact of that abomination on the screen. He never would have allowed anyone else to see this, but it hurt. Seeing the horror that was \u201cSepiks\u201d made anew.<br/><br/>\nHis people had fallen. <br/><br/>\nVariks stared at the image of Sepiks. And as he\u2019d done before, he wondered what would have gone differently had he been there, among his people. Could he have stopped this before it happened? Could he have found them a better way?<br/><br/>\n\u201cMust be a better way for Eliksni.\u201d He clicked quietly. \u201cMust be a way to stop the Fall.\u201d",

        "cardDescription": "Radegast strode through the ashes. A cloud hung in his wake as he made his way to the top of the rise. Scars marred his armor, and his sidearm lay in the dust. He didn&#39;t need it, now. The battle was over.<br/><br/>\nThis had been a mining outpost, once. A few buildings and a transport. Nestled amid a small forest, it had been like a precious jewel set atop the dull crown of the wildlands.<br/><br/>\nNow there was almost nothing left. The warrior began to walk slowly down into the valley. He pulled his helm from his head and let it drop with a muted thud into the ash. Of the forest, only stumps remained. Of the small village there was no trace; the buildings reduced to splinters. Here and there you could see dull gray signs of inhabitation.<br/><br/>\nAt the bottom of the valley, Radegast came to the source of the ash, death, and violence. The Light-bearers were laid out in a row, simple cloth covering their armored and robed forms. There were five of them, and they had been lined up beneath the melted girders of the settlement&#39;s great hall. <br/><br/>\nThese warlords had terrorized this part of the wilds for years. Hundreds had died at their hands. <br/><br/>\nRadegast turned as his companions crossed the valley floor to join him. They had been policing the dead, finding a fitting end for the settlers and miners of the outpost. Jolder came with a steady glide, energy and fire. Saladin, calm and slow, the weight of the dead on his shoulders. In formation behind them stepped Perun, her boots barely leaving a trace as she walked. They gathered before him.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Never again.&quot; He intoned the words quietly. The others stood as battle-scarred statues. <br/><br/>\n&quot;We ride against despots and warlords. We hide in these enclaves, hoping that other Light-bearers will not find us. We fear each other.&quot; He shook his head, his fists clenched. <br/><br/>\n&quot;And we should not. We are stronger, together. We are mighty, together. All we have to fear is... this.&quot; He pointed down at the dead warlords. &quot;Giving in. Allowing the power of the Light to blind us to what we truly are.&quot;<br/><br/>\nIt was Perun, of course, who asked the question. &quot;What are we?&quot; No judgment. No reproach. <br/><br/>\nStill, Radegast could feel their doubt. He turned upwards, and his eyes settled on the massive span that supported the hall. His eyes shone as he turned back to his fellows.<br/><br/>\n&quot;We will be what the people need us to be. We will be guardians. We will be protectors. We will hold the last of us together.&quot;<br/><br/>\nHis voice rang out across the still valley. &quot;Our days of hiding are ended. Say it now, each of you. Who among the other bearers do you trust? Who can be counted on to ride with us?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Bretomart,\u201d said Jolder.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Deidris,&quot; said Perun.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I trust only you, Radegast,&quot; said Saladin, and their leader scowled in response.<br/><br/>\n&quot;What are you saying? What are we?&quot; Perun asked again.<br/><br/>\nRadegast smiled. &quot;We will gather those you trust. We will not wait for this&quot;\u2014he gestured around him\u2014 &quot;to force our hand. We will ride against those that would use the Light against our own. Humanity must have protectors. Like the knights of old.&quot;<br/><br/>\nAround them, the dust swirled in the air. Shafts of sunlight coalesced in long slanted bars as the sun dipped towards the horizon. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Are you with me? Will you stand with me\u2014 as Iron Lords?&quot;<br/><br/>\nIn the waning light, their answers rang like thunder on the air.",

        "cardDescription": "Perun stood at the top of a sloping, narrow path cut into a steep plateau. It was not yet dawn, and the valley below her was foggy and dark.<br/><br/>\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not coming.\u201d This from a thin woman at Perun\u2019s side, the mayor of the crumbling silvery ruins on the plateau behind them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want you wolves here. Lord Segoth knows that.\u201d<br/><br/>\nIn answer, Perun pointed into the valley. A red light had appeared.<br/><br/>\nThe mayor let out a wail. &quot;Segoth will kill us all. Or worse, he&#39;ll leave us to the Fallen.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun shook her head. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d <br/><br/>\nThe mayor looked at Perun and the two Titans standing on her other side. Then she turned and ran back into the village. <br/><br/>\nThe red lights were larger; already the faint, choppy whine of repaired Pikes filled their ears. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Nine of them,&quot; said Saladin.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNine, nine hundred, they still gotta come up the pass three at a time.\u201d She cracked her knuckles. \u201cEasy pickins.\u201d<br/><br/>\nRadegast looked at her. &quot;The north and south roads are undefended. If they change course\u2014&quot;<br/><br/>\n\u201cThey won&#39;t.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s about making people afraid\u2014 of Segoth, and of us. Seeing his goons coming a ways off, knowing he&#39;s coming for blood... the dread is part of the punishment. Anyway, he doesn&#39;t expect we&#39;ll still be here. So he takes the west road, &#39;cause it&#39;s the most visible, and the most direct.&quot;<br/><br/>\nRadegast frowned. &quot;Then it&#39;s time to show Segoth that his tyranny will end.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Not just Segoth,&quot; said Perun. She jerked a thumb toward the ruins behind her. Watchful faces poked out of windows and around tarps. &quot;We gotta show them.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe three of them picked up large, rough-hewn metal shields. Behind their shields, each held a worn rifle, wrapped with cloth and chain mail.<br/><br/>\nThe Pike-riders&#39; faces were now visible through early morning gloom. A man in long red robes pulled his Pike ahead as they screeched to a halt.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Segoth. \u201cThe Iron Wolves.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cCease your insults,\u201d Saladin barked. <br/><br/>\nPerun shot him a surprised look. \u201cThat\u2019s an insult? I kinda like \u2018Wolves.\u2019\u201d<br/><br/>\n&quot;Begone, wolves,\u201d Segoth sneered. \u201cThese people are mine.\u201d<br/><br/>\n&quot;Wrong,&quot; Radegast retorted. &quot;You abuse the powers the Traveler has entrusted us.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSegoth smiled, and shrugged.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Shields up!&quot; Perun shouted.<br/><br/>\nA hail of bullets slammed into their shields. Perun, Radegast, and Saladin slid backwards on the dusty path. But they dug in their heels, and the shields held. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Return fire!&quot;<br/><br/>\nTrapped in the narrow path, Segoth and his warriors fell one by one. <br/><br/>\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin reloaded and then Segoth was up again, his glowing Ghost at his shoulder. He fired wildly, and a bullet struck Radegast in the head. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Got him!&quot; Perun shouted as Radegast collapsed.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Covering you!&quot; Saladin returned. <br/><br/>\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin died many more times than any one of Segoth&#39;s men. But any time one of them fell, another would cover them until they staggered to their feet again. The shield wall held. The three gave no ground. <br/><br/>\nFinally, his robes singed and ragged, Segoth signaled a retreat. <br/><br/>\n\u201cIron Wolves!\u201d he shouted as his warriors scattered and a cheer went up from the people in the silver ruins. \u201cI will slaughter everyone who has ever sheltered you!&quot;<br/><br/>\nIn answer, Perun shot him again.",

        "cardDescription": "Deep inside a clandestine stronghold sat the Dark Horse Felwinter and Citan, Warlord of the 32nd Sector of Old Russia. A polished obsidian table rested heavily between them.<br/><br/>\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the courage to come back here,\u201d said the Warlord.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSituational awareness. Not courage. I go where I can do the most good. Thank you for seeing me.\u201d Felwinter\u2019s voice sounded as hollow as his helmet. Citan wanted to knock it clean off the Iron Lord\u2019s bony shoulders. He could do it with a single punch.<br/><br/>\n\u201cAs I recall, you used to have a throne on that Light-forsaken peak, \u2018til you joined up with the wolves. You\u2019re the only Warlord I know who held an entire mountain.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cFelwinter Peak.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo one ever calls it that.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe Iron Lords do. Though they did ask me to take that throne down.\u201d<br/><br/>\nCitan\u2019s laugh shook the room. \u201cHow is losing territory ever a good thing for a Warlord?\u201d Felwinter folded his hands atop the table. Underneath it, Citan made two fists, a crescent of Light flickering between them.<br/><br/>\n\u201cJoin us and find out,\u201d said the Iron Lord. \u201cTurn your sector over to us. You can still patrol it, of course.\u201d<br/><br/>\nCitan\u2019s voice lowered.  \u201cOf course. You know I\u2019ll refuse.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll put you down, and take your territory by force. Over and over again if we have to.\u201d<br/><br/>\n \u201cI invite you to my home after you abandon us, and you come to threaten me?\u201d The Warlord stood, towering over Felwinter.<br/><br/>\n\u201cTo broker peace.\u201d Citan thought that even the voice behind the helmet didn\u2019t believe what it said. The floor shuddered as the Warlord upended the massive table with one hand.  It smashed into the opposite wall, as tendrils of Void Light passed through it and coalesced into Felwinter\u2019s leaping form.<br/><br/>\nCitan had seen this parlor trick before, and judged that he could hammer the Iron Lord out of the air\u2014<br/><br/>\nBut Felwinter\u2019s momentum continued into a knee-lift that smashed into Citan\u2019s head as the larger man reared back to strike. The Warlord fell, the front of his helm shattering. Felwinter landed next to Citan\u2019s prone body.<br/><br/>\n\u201cLady Jolder taught me that. I can\u2019t say the Iron Lords haven\u2019t done me any favors,\u201d the voice intoned. <br/><br/>\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ll burn the world down before we let the Iron Lords rule it,\u201d the larger man gasped, breathing out of his mouth, his face a bloody mess. The Void Light in Felwinter\u2019s hand snapped\u2014and so did the Warlord\u2019s neck.<br/><br/>\n\u201cRadegast is scattered. Perun is indecisive. Silimar wants to build a tower and hide. But they\u2019re going to change the world; no one can stop them,\u201d Felwinter said quietly to the corpse. He parted his coat and drew a bronze shotgun. \u201cWill it be for the better? I don\u2019t know. But they mean to end the fighting, so I don\u2019t have to sleep with my back to the wall every night, Light in my hand. And that\u2019s not nothing.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe paused, as if waiting for something.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNormally, this is where I ask you to reconsider. Tell you that you should come with me. See how powerful your Light can become. But I know you, Citan. What you do with the land you take, with its people. The other Lords\u2014especially Saladin\u2014might let you walk away. I\u2019m not going to give them the chance.\u201d<br/><br/>\nCitan\u2019s Ghost sparked into view from above, bringing its eye to bear on its fallen charge. The Warlord emerged from a radiant column, a frenzied shout at his lips.<br/><br/>\nFelwinter\u2019s shotgun cracked like thunder\u2014once for the Warlord, and again for his Ghost.",

The scavenged pieces of an Ahamkara, several jumbled coyote skeletons, and a fossil mastodon skull are mixed in with them. The bones are scorched and battered from the various grenades, bullets, and hammers he&#39;s taken to them. He keeps extensive notes on these stress tests in a tattered notebook with &quot;Field Armor Experiments&quot; scrawled on its cover. So far, though, he hasn&#39;t tried his knives on these materials. Between bones, in the joints and gaps, certainly, but not on them.<br/><br/>\nGheleon flips Swiftling and catches it by the haft. He throws it, a single smooth motion, and it shatters a Fallen tibia.<br/><br/>\nHe flips Occam and throws it. The knife clatters off an Ahamkara vertebra.<br/><br/>\nHe flips Quietus and\u2014<br/><br/>\n&quot;Shanks and pikes, Efrideet!&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Ooh, that&#39;s the last yip it&#39;s yipped,&quot; she says, picking up the coyote jaw that Quietus impaled. &quot;Helmet, would you say?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Too brittle. Etherbone\u2019s better. Flexes.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe others follow her in, wrinkling their noses. Usually they avoid his dim and earth-smelling den. Their presence suggests that Felwinter is doing something unpleasant, probably involving screams.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Bone?&quot; Saladin says. &quot;Not carbon bronze? Not plasteel?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Bone\u2019s always available as a last resort. Nothing else is.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;This is doomsday thinking,&quot; Jolder says, kicking aside fragments of bone. &quot;We have your back. Our plate is strong. When&#39;ll you need scavenged armor?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;If all of you were cut down around me, your Light drained past return, and my own armor was shredded. F\u2019r instance.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThere is a long silence.<br/><br/>\n&quot;You always know what to say to make us feel better,&quot; Efrideet says.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I could hide under your bodies until the threat left. Then I\u2019d make a helmet from all your skulls and a breastplate from your ribs and gloves from your finger bones wrapped around mine.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThere is a longer silence.",

        "cardDescription": "Lord Silimar died for his pile of stones.<br/><br/>\nHe died when the Fallen took it in the battle of Alms. He died when the warlords destroyed it in their third great barrage. He died, blade through his eye, when the House of Devils smashed it in their westward campaign. <br/>\nHe died on the structure\u2019s great steps, cut down by an advancing line of Archons, and when the stonework fell to cluster bombs. <br/><br/>\nHe died in the structure\u2019s sprawling shadow and upon its vaunted heights. <br/><br/>\nOnce, during a Fallen siege, while the battlements crumbled beneath his feet, he leapt from its parapet, so that he might know the structure more fully, might feel the weight of the sky pressing down on all that stone and steel. <br/>\n\u201cThe better to raise its next incarnation,\u201d he said to those allies who later questioned his madness. As the Fallen charged, Silimar refused to abandon what he\u2019d built, though others retreated to a stronger position. \u201cGo,\u201d he told them. \u201cSave yourselves. I\u2019ll slow them down.\u201d  <br/><br/>\nThe enemy came in overwhelming force. A breaking wave of blades and firepower and death. Atop the structure\u2019s central bulwark, Lord Silimar held his ground. <br/><br/>\n\u201cTake it if you can, you bastards!\u201d He shouted at the swarming enemy.<br/><br/>\nHe leapt upon the great edifice and there put up a final stand as the enemy engulfed him. He died with his dagger in the guts of an Archon while the great structure shook with explosions and rained stones down upon the land.  <br/>\nLater that night, when Lord Silimar rose again from the ashes, he found Lord Saladin already there and waiting, standing near the place where he\u2019d made his final stand.  <br/><br/>\n\u201cThis structure is doomed,\u201d Saladin said in the darkness. \u201cYou must know this.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cNot doomed,\u201d Silimar said. \u201cFated, perhaps. Doomed is too strong a word.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cUse whatever word you like, but there\u2019s another word that applies to this place: indefensible. And yet after each defeat, you rebuild.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI seek only to build it more perfectly.\u201d<br/><br/>\nLord Saladin shook his head. \u201cOnly a fool would raise the same structure again and again.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThese stones are like us,\u201d Lord Silimar said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d<br/><br/>\nSilimar rose to his feet. He walked among the smoking ruins. The shattered blocks. He glanced down at the piled corpses of dead enemies. The charred remains of a once-great citadel now reduced to scattered rubble.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThey knock us down, you and me,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut time and again, we rise. Like this place.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cEleven times they\u2019ve destroyed what you\u2019ve built,\u201d Saladin said. \u201cWhy rebuild what will be knocked down?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBecause one time they won\u2019t be able to,\u201d Silimar said. \u201cAnd when that day comes, when this perfect, indefensible structure stays standing, then we\u2019ll know.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know what?\u201d<br/><br/>\nLord Silimar looked at his old friend. Then he turned and strode the broken stones, and looked out over the ruins that spread away into the distance. \u201cThen we\u2019ll know it\u2019s safe to build our city to the sky.\u201d",

        "cardDescription": "<i>At the west end of a deep valley stands a castle, its crumbling stone walls patched with glossy sheets of metal and glass. The castle entrance is a wrought-iron portcullis flanked by two motion-sensing turrets. In the valley below, just out of the turrets&#39; range, rests a gold-and-gray transport ship. The symbol of the Iron Lords shines with an otherworldly glow on its folded wings. </i><br/><br/><i>The Iron Lords have come to challenge Warlord Rience.</i><br/><br/><i>Two Sparrows skim lightly over the grass as they head toward the ship, the castle at their backs.</i><i>Perun and Radegast dismount.</i><i>They nod to each other wordlessly, and part.</i><br/><br/>\nPerun walked up the ship\u2019s gangplank and made straight for Jolder&#39;s room. She hit the door controls and stepped inside.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m almost ready,&quot; Jolder said, before Perun could speak. <br/><br/>\nJolder stood next to a chest full of weapons, armor and other gear.  She flashed Perun a bright smile as she cinched the straps of her gold-and-white cuirass.<br/><br/>\nThe corners of Perun&#39;s mouth twitched. &quot;I came to tell you Rience agreed to the single combat. Guess I don\u2019t need to.\u201d<br/><br/>\nJolder smiled. &quot;I figured he would. Your plans have a way of working out.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun leaned against the doorframe. &quot;Saladin and Efrideet both volunteered to be your second.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Hm.&quot;  Jolder took a pair of gauntlets out of the chest and put them on. &quot;Saladin&#39;s better at staying calm under pressure.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;We need a second, it&#39;s \u2018cause you&#39;re dead. No one will be calm.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Right. Efrideet, then. She fights better when she&#39;s angry.&quot; Jolder tightened the straps of her gauntlets, then made a fist. &quot;Hold this?&quot; She handed Perun a shield, golden and reflective as a mirror. <br/><br/>\nPerun rolled her eyes, but held the shield up, front toward Jolder.<br/><br/>\nJolder took a small pot of black liquid and a thin brush out of the chest, then stood in front of the shield and began lining her left eye with kohl. &quot;Who\u2019re they sending?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Melig.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Do you know that, or do you just <i>know</i>?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Just know,&quot; Perun said. &quot;Rience will figure we send you. So, how to respond? He thinks bigger is better. So, Melig.&quot; <br/><br/>\nJolder smiled. &quot;Tell Rience he can send two. Otherwise\u2014&quot; Jolder finished the line of kohl with a flick of her wrist, leaving a sharp black wing at the corner of her eye. &quot;My battle-paint will be for nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun chuckled drily, without smiling. &quot;Not the best tactical move.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;But it&#39;d be more fun.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun grunted.<br/><br/>\nJolder arched her brow, her right eye half-painted, and looked over the shield rim at Perun. &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun ran a hand through her close-cropped hair. &quot;Don\u2019t know yet. Seems... too easy. I were Rience, I&#39;d be thinking about poison, neurojammers... Man like him with nothing to lose, might even target your Ghost.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Perun.&quot; Jolder took the shield from Perun&#39;s arms and placed a gauntleted hand on Perun&#39;s shoulder. Her eyes flashed between lines of thick black kohl as she smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d <br/><br/>\nPerun sighed, then placed her hand over Jolder&#39;s. &quot;True.\u201d <br/><br/>\nJolder slung her shield across her back, tucked her helmet under her arm, and hefted her enormous battle-axe casually over one armored shoulder. In her full battle harness, she towered over Perun, the plates of her gold-and-white armor gleaming in the dim light. <br/><br/>\n&quot;All right,&quot; Jolder smiled. &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;",

It joins dozens of others on the floor. Keeps muttering to herself.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Felwinter. Radegast. Gheleon. Hell, even Efrideet, not that she&#39;s likely to get a verse now. Haven&#39;t seen her in weeks, anyway. Bunch of dactyls, all of you.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun strides in, a rifle under each arm. Notices Skorri and smirks. Skorri grins at her.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Why couldn&#39;t the other Iron Lords have followed your lead, huh? &#39;Perun, in shadow clad, behind the shield / through cleansing fire our hiding foes revealed&#39;.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun doesn&#39;t slow. &quot;Did you just make that up right as I walked in here?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Of course I did! You&#39;re iambic! You give me something to work with! Mmm, we do work well together.&quot;<br/><br/>\nPerun laughs despite herself, shakes her head, leaves.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Hardly my best effort, though. Plus, there&#39;s no room for Silimar in there, except for his shield.&quot;<br/><br/>\nShe picks up the pen again, fiddles with it, stares up at the ceiling.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Maybe something about that shield? Keeps everything out, keeps everyone out, protects himself so he can&#39;t get hurt? Hmm. Too on the nose? He does have a nice nose.&quot;<br/><br/>\nTwo more Iron Lords walk through, all business. One rolls her eyes at Skorri, splayed on the couch. Skorri doesn&#39;t notice them enter or leave.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Radegast goes in, I know that much. Known the old man too long to leave him out. Might even make it into the chorus. After Skorri, though. That goes without\u2014 hey, Gheleon, what&#39;s the rush?&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe Hunter stops, halfway out the door. Turns around slowly. Doesn&#39;t speak.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I thought you were supposed to be the careful one. In such a hurry to get back out there?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;A quick death is preferable to the alternative.&quot;<br/><br/>\nSkorri makes a face. &quot;Well, that&#39;s rude. Hey, I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d be willing to cut out your name&#39;s second syllable?&quot;<br/><br/>\nGheleon sighs. &quot;You&#39;re STILL working on the Iron Song? Why don&#39;t you just change the meter if it bothers you so much?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Change the\u2014 are you kidding me? Why don&#39;t YOU just change to using a... a whip?&quot;<br/><br/>\nGheleon closes his eyes, turns, walks out.<br/><br/>\n&quot;&#39;Change the meter&#39;. Unbelievable.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;You know, Skorri, some of us have real work to do.&quot;<br/><br/>\nAnother Iron Lord. This one&#39;s young. Skorri doesn&#39;t recognize him.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Have you forgotten about the ambush tomorrow? Or are you too busy writing limericks?&quot;<br/><br/>\nSkorri&#39;s looking up at the ceiling. No response. The young one&#39;s mad now.<br/><br/>\n&quot;A lot of people are relying on us, Skorri. If you don&#39;t think you&#39;re up for\u2014&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Hunters up top, 11 o&#39;clock on the ridge. Two shots to the Servitor, draw their attention up. I come in with Radiance, Dregs are blinded, Jolder&#39;s powered up, she rushes in, splits &#39;em in half. You hopefully don&#39;t trip over your cloak like you did back at the Flood Zone, but I&#39;m not optimistic. The rest come out of the cave, take out the Captain, Felwinter finishes off the south group with a Bomb, everything else is candy.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe young one still looks mad as he leaves.<br/><br/>\n&quot;&#39;The Dregs are blinded, Jolder&#39;s powered up / she rushes in and splits the group in half.&#39; Huh.

        "cardDescription": "Timur\u2019s Stormtrance tears through a gang of Dregs as Felwinter stumbles through the shifting sands behind him, miles inland of what remains of the Arabian Shores. <br/><br/>\n\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Felwinter rushes to Timur\u2019s side, his eyes jumping focus, anticipating another attack. <br/><br/>\n\u201cYou seem far too obsessed with these \u2018Warminds\u2019.\u201d Timur stops and stares into the horizon as if smelling something; not danger, discovery.  He draws his fellow Iron Lord close. \u201cTell me, <i>Fel</i>winter,\u201d he whispers, \u201cwhat does the word <i>Seraph</i> mean to you?\u201d <br/><br/>\nFelwinter leans in to whisper back. \u201cOld Earth theology? I know its power well; one can make great use of the traps of faith and its myths.\u201d   <br/><br/>\n\u201cDamn you, Exos!\u201d The whisper game abandoned. \u201cDo you even ponder the before? Or that number etched into your \u2018flesh\u2019? Do you see yourself in your dreams? Th\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\nA shank. Then another, then more. Felwinter hits the ground and reaches for his sidearm. Timur hates interruptions and his face shows it. A wash of Arc Light grows in his hands and erupts as the pack of machine dogs falls nearly in unison. <br/><br/>\nTimur grabs Felwinter, bringing him back to his feet, and says, \u201cHave you ever wondered what it is that calls to you in that void of memory, where the edge of the past infects your present?\u201d He returns to his game of whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s an itch you can\u2019t scratch, isn\u2019t it? Well maybe you can.\u201d <br/><br/>\n\u201cYou think I am one of them? That all Exo are\u2014\u201d <br/><br/>\n\u201cLord Felwinter, I know what you are. And you are no Warmind or even one of its puppets. Come. You must see this.\u201d He makes a gesture like he\u2019s casting a spell over the sand. \u201cFollow my footfalls; this area\u2019s rigged with dirty Fallen nonsense.\u201d <br/><br/>\nThey struggle up the dunes. Felwinter glides ahead. As he lands, a sandstorm rises to meet him. More shanks. Hundreds of them. Behind them, a lone Vandal sniper lays down covering fire. <br/><br/>\nFelwinter, realizing his mistake, runs back toward Timur, shielding himself in the Light of suns. <br/><br/>\nTimur continues forward, grasps the brass familiar around his neck, and closes his eyes. A slight hum rises and his trance takes him deep into the sea of shanks, his trusted Lash raised and tearing his path through the darkness. Felwinter is slow to follow, but fast enough to witness Timur\u2019s focus turn shanks by the pack against their Vandal keeper, chasing him back toward the sea. <br/><br/>\nTimur rushes to Felwinter, examining his head with the intensity of a Cryptarch. <br/><br/>\n\u201cHmm. Warmind. You are certainly as stubborn as one.\u201d <br/><br/>\nFelwinter awkwardly pulls himself away and out of Timur\u2019s reach.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWith all respect, Lord Timur, whatever game you are playing with me has gone on far too long. This is just another Dead Zone.\u201d  <br/><br/>\n\u201cOh, is it?\u201d<br/><br/>\nTimur directs Felwinter\u2019s eyes toward the eastern horizon, where a building crowned with the initials \u201cC.B.\u201d is now in view.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWe all have creators \u2014 humans, Exo, Warminds, even those poor Awoken. Some are just easier to find.\u201d",

What we once believed to be a colonial tool of the Warminds, destroyed long ago, appears to be active again. This time, there is no sign of any active Rasputin networks.  My summation: SIVA is actually a nanotechnology capable of breaking down any existing matter very similar to Glimmer. <br/>\nUnfortunately, these SIVA mites reuse the energy and matter based on a set of programmable directives. SIVA does not cease until said directives are complete. I fear what this could mean for us all and suggest we instigate a system-wide scan for anything bearing the enclosed signatures.",
